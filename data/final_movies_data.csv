11,El Camino had a different ending originally (Spoilers),"Source: https://ew.com/tv/2019/10/14/aaron-paul-vince-gilligan-breaking-bad-el-camino-alternate-endings/

One of Gilligan’s quotes from the article:

&gt;I didn’t get super far down the road, but it was probably going to be a young woman who needed some help,” he says. “He was hiding out by the Canadian border, and this woman was working at a motel as a housekeeper or something.  [He] goes into the process of saving her, knowing full well that he’s going to suffer for it, he’s going to get caught for it, but he does it anyway. And the last scene would be maybe him in a jail cell but at peace for the first time since the movie began. I think there was going to be this component where he couldn’t sleep. He wouldn’t get a single night sleep for a week or so upon escaping. The police are looking for him and he’s too haunted and he’s too adrenaline-charged. And at the end of the thing, he’s in a jail cell, and ironically he can fall asleep like a baby. And I thought, ‘Ah, that’d be kind of cool.'”

Apparently Golligan’s partner as well as Peter Gould helped change his mind

I actually might like this ending more? Have to think about it.

**EDIT**:

More here.

&gt;**After Breaking Bad ended, you said that Jesse Pinkman was free, that he successfully got away. All these years, you maintained that. But I wondered if you had second thoughts as you started to write the movie. Were there other possibilities you considered?**
﻿
&gt;Yes, I did. I like irony in storytelling. I love ironic twists. Once I had set about coming up with this movie, for the longest time I had it in my mind that the thing we wanted most to see was for Jesse to escape. And the thing he wanted most to do was escape. So I was trying to concoct a plot in which, hero that he is, he saves somebody else — somebody I would have introduced as a new character into the movie. Because he’s such an innately heroic character in my mind, he saves someone at the end of the movie and he willfully gets himself caught knowing that it’ll save this other person. At the end of the movie, he’d be locked in a jail cell somewhere in Montana or someplace. And he would be at peace with it. It was all this very interior, emo-type, very dramatic stuff.

&gt;I pitched it to my girlfriend, Holly, and she said, “Are you out of your mind? You can’t have him in a jail cell at the end. You got to let him get away. People will riot.” I said, “No, don’t you get it? It’s art. It’s artistic.” And then I said, “No offense, you’re not a writer. I respect you, of course, and I love you. But you’re not a writer.” And then I went the next day and pitched it to Peter [Gould] and the writers of Better Call Saul, and they all looked at me in silence. They said, “Are you crazy? He’s got to get away at the end.” [Laughs.] As the saying goes, if enough people tell you you’re drunk, you need to sit down. So I dispensed with that idea.

&gt;**Had you worked out who this new character was going to be?**

&gt;I hadn’t quite worked it out. To my credit, I was kicking this idea around, but I didn’t get too far down the road with it. I didn’t actually start writing it, but I had some pretty definitive ideas. I spent a couple of weeks on that. But I’m glad I discarded it. Sometimes you succeed by giving people the opposite of what they want, but sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes you just got to give folks what they want.

53,"It's time for my annual rewatch of the extended edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's insane that movies never, ever get old","Almost 2 decades since their release, imo the LOTR trilogy still remains the absolute peak of fantasy film-making. As I prepare to rewatch the entire thing for the 10th year in a row, it really boggles my mind that no matter how many times I watch them, the sheer enjoyment and exhilaration of taking this journey never, ever gets old or any less fun than it did when I first watched it.

There are so many things that make these movies as rewatchable as they are - the actors who truly breathed life into their well-developed characters, the incredible production/art design and set pieces, the deep lore and worldbuilding, the gorgeous scenery etc. etc. What I  personally really find that stands out to me, and why they never seem to get old, is that feeling of adventure and continuously escalating stakes. The first movie is fairly low-stakes, starting off in the cozy Shire and following the characters through a series of narrow escapes and chase scenes. But the scope just continues to widen, not just in every movie, but pretty much every set piece, until it leads to an all-out war in the ROTK. It really gets you invested in the fate of the world and the characters, and genuinely care about what happens as things get more epic.

76,1001 List Review: The Heiress,"The Heiress 1949

Plot Synopsis:

Catherine (Olivia de Havilland), a young woman who stands to inherit her father's large fortune, falls in love when she meets Morris (Montgomery Clift), who gives her the love and affection her father doesn't, and which she desperately needs. Catherine's father (Ralph Richardson), believing Morris is only after the money, tells Catherine she will be disinherited if she marries him. Morris' true intentions are put to the test when he finds out about the amended will.

 [https://imgur.com/a/GCCCVXz](https://imgur.com/a/GCCCVXz) 

My Take:

  
I always have a bit of difficulty getting fully invested into any movie I watch. This one drew me in without my even realizing it. I was embarrassed by the titular Heiress’s naivete, I was suspicious of the intentions of her suitor, I got a sick sense of amusement whenever her father pointed out she had almost no good qualities and many bad ones (which he does often). In short, I felt along with this movie, despite its age. I was going to chalk up the fact I liked it to simply being susceptible to melodrama due to years of watching *The Young and Restless* along with my parents during dinner, but I realized there was another reason; the main character wised up and grew and got her little piece of revenge at the end. It's not just some tragedy.

You will be embarrassed for the heiress at the beginning and cheer for her at the end, a sign of an enthralling narrative. Also note she didn’t have/want/need another man to replace the one who betrayed her at the end. The original story was written by a married couple, which probably played a part in how independent she became over the course of the story.

Context:

Film was released in 1949 and set in the 1850’s. Although, other than the peculiarities of courtship at the time, I’d say the events of the story are pretty timeless. Seeing how people operated in a courtship centered social space instead of a dating one is a bit of a culture shock, but the historical goings on at the time are ultimately unimportant to the story. That [Lucky Old Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3kvxN3xFc) by Frankie Laine was the number one song by sales in 1949. Obviously no data exists for 1850 for such a thing.

Should you watch it? Yes!",movies,"1001 List Review: The Heiress The Heiress 1949

Plot Synopsis:

Catherine (Olivia de Havilland), a young woman who stands to inherit her father's large fortune, falls in love when she meets Morris (Montgomery Clift), who gives her the love and affection her father doesn't, and which she desperately needs. Catherine's father (Ralph Richardson), believing Morris is only after the money, tells Catherine she will be disinherited if she marries him. Morris' true intentions are put to the test when he finds out about the amended will.

My Take:

  
I always have a bit of difficulty getting fully invested into any movie I watch. This one drew me in without my even realizing it. I was embarrassed by the titular Heiress’s naivete, I was suspicious of the intentions of her suitor, I got a sick sense of amusement whenever her father pointed out she had almost no good qualities and many bad ones (which he does often). In short, I felt along with this movie, despite its age. I was going to chalk up the fact I liked it to simply being susceptible to melodrama due to years of watching *The Young and Restless* along with my parents during dinner, but I realized there was another reason; the main character wised up and grew and got her little piece of revenge at the end. It's not just some tragedy.

You will be embarrassed for the heiress at the beginning and cheer for her at the end, a sign of an enthralling narrative. Also note she didn’t have/want/need another man to replace the one who betrayed her at the end. The original story was written by a married couple, which probably played a part in how independent she became over the course of the story.

77,What do you feel about crime films?,"I love true crime books, crime/gangster documentaries and crime films of all genres. Heist, gangster, film noir, murder mysteries and etc. It's so fascinating what trouble criminals can get themselves into. 

I always see a criminal as someone who needlessly puts his life on the line every time he steps outside his door. Like his life is a stack of poker chips that can get called on by anyone at anytime on a hand they can't even see yet. Whether he's a crime boss, gangster, hitman, robber, drug dealer, thief, adulterer who plans to kill his wife and etc.

My top ten films will probably be all crime films. My top 2 favorites would be Goodfellas 1A and Pulp Fiction 1B. 

I believe the crime genre is the most ripe genre to create wall-to-wall drama if handled correctly? Who dies? Or goes to prison? Who snitches? What innocent lives are put into jeopardy?

79,Million Dollar Baby (2004). Clint Eastwood's neo-noir sports drama reminds us how films are best created.,"Currently watching Clint Eastwood's filmography for the first time. Never seen any of his work before. So far I've seen Mystic River, Gran Torino, and Million Dollar Baby.

What an amazing filmmaker he is. His style is like an entirely new genre of cinema that I've never experienced.

Million Dollar Baby is truly one of the best films I have ever seen and I say that without any hesitation. The film is just so excellent at depicting characters with clarity and truth. I sat in silence for the entire length of the film because I was drawn so deeply into the lives of Maggie and Frankie that I was unable to comprehend that I was even watching a movie. The experience was unparalleled.

Everything was just so real. Clint Eastwood pays attention to the films supporting characters, who make the surrounding world feel incredibly genuine.

The dialogue is masterful. Hilary Swank is nothing short of electrifying in every scene she's in. The way she carries Maggie with a particular intensity and deep attentive gaze completely blew me away.

edit: she won an academy award for this performance. not surprised.

The cinematography is sensational. Characters' faces would slide in and out of shadow. The use and disuse of lighting was wonderfully obedient to the tone of each scene.

I could not recommend a film more highly. What a remarkable movie.",movies,"Million Dollar Baby (2004). Clint Eastwood's neo-noir sports drama reminds us how films are best created.

83,*Before Sunrise*,"So I tried watching Before Sunrise two years back and I just ended it after they got off the train and thought that it might be some kind of a boring movie. Well after two years, I watched Before Sunrise today. And this movie is amazing on so many levels. It just made me connect. No thriller, nothing. Just two individuals on a journey of life. Happening to meet one another. Having a connection. Discussing things that at this point of my life I wanted to discuss it with someone. Having the time of their life in just one day. I mean its amazing. The way they layer by layer express themselves to one another, slowly remove the boundaries they had created. Its all so beautiful. And on the other hand this film itself is so calming. Like so much calming I can't even describe. This just dawned upon me that how only one day can make or break you. They just had a day to themselves. And all they could do was just build up their connection. And at the end they had to part.
Slipping a little bit away from the movie, I think that we all kind of incomplete in some way. We need people who can understand us, who can give us healthy criticism, who can indulge in our fantansies with us!! We all need someone in sort of any relationship that might be. It doesn't always need to be a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship. You just need someone who can have a heart to heart with you!!

PS. I was 15 two years back and I totally wouldn't have understood it back then like I did today. Because I'm a changed person now. And my outlook on life has changed. We all evolve as the years go by!! It was surely a good time now to come across this movie!!

89,Which Are The Best Victim Characters In Horror Films?,"Horror films are notorious for generally having very disposable and unlikable characters with no much personality to them. They are mostly just there to be killed by the serial killer and to try to survive. However, there are at times where there are victims in horror films that are compelling and have far more depth to them than average victim character.

One of my favorite examples are Mima Kirigoe from ""Perfect Blue"", who despite being part of the trope of the ""innocent girl become mature"", she does go beyond that. Mima is a character who, while acts stereotypically like a good girl, does surprisingly have more humanity to her and does have her more conflicting and darker thoughts, which is shown through the fake Mima, which represents her self-doubt, self-judgement, her desire to hold to her past and other feelings that she keeps inside her but at the same time, a side in her that taunts her. While she cares about others and wants to help, she also desires something better for herself and she doesn't feel happy at all with what she doesn't. She doesn't always accept being part of tjis contribution and that makes her hold a grudge for herself even getting involved in something that she feels will make her be seen in an negative way by society and also a grudge for the people she is trying to help for contributing for the change in her career and persona. She is far more complex than many victim characters that you typically see in horror.

And there's Carrie White from 1976's ""Carrie"". Although, I am fairly conflicted by choosing her since she is kinda practically the villian as she is responsible for the horror that occurs later. However, she is definitely portrayed as a victim in the movie. A victim of bullying, abuse from her mother, the shame of her sexuality and gender and trauma, which leads her into causing the prom massacre. Not to mention that her crazy, religious mother tries to kill her at the end. She is one of my favorite female characters in film.",movies,"Which Are The Best Victim Characters In Horror Films?

95,What are the best comedy movies of all time?,"I love Elf as a Christmas film and think it’s Will Ferrell’s best. I would also suggest people to watch Some Like It Hot for an old comedy, it’s a great movie that stands the test of time, but Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is my personal favorite. Steve Martin and John Candy are both great in the movie, and the message really shines through, to a point where I think the performances and emotional impact elevates the film over other comedies in its genre. I know a lot of people would say Ferris Bueller or The Breakfast Club is Hughes’ best film, but I believe it’s PT&amp;A. To me, it’s a timeless holiday classic that’s aged well compared to most comedies of the era. 

For more raunchy comedies, I’d also highly recommend The Forty Year Old Virgin, Superbad, and There’s Something About Mary. For anyone who liked Superbad, Pineapple Express is also really hilarious. The Cornetto Trilogy is also very good: Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and The World’s End are all solid comedy movies. For anyone who enjoys the Coen Brothers, I’d suggest that you watch The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading if you didn’t already. Groundhog Day is another movie that I‘d say, is a level above most comedies; the premise and story are great, and I believe it’s Bill Murray’s best movie and performance.

114,I did not enjoy Ad Astra.,"Don't get me wrong, there were some parts of the movie that I really liked. I loved the opening scene on the space tower. The effects and lighting choices were top-notch throughout. The Mad Max chase on the moon was really fun. The scene in the comms room on Mars was excellent.

However, there were way too many parts of the movie that bugged me for me to fully buy into it.

- The voice-over narration. It felt really clunky and unnecessary almost every time.
- The space monkeys. Not only is that scene really absurd, but it has no bearing on the plot, and feels like it's only in the movie to add one more action scene.
- The scene where...
    1. The protagonist sneaks onboard a rocket by climbing up the side during the launch countdown.
    2. When he gets onboard, every member of the crew immediately whips out a space-gun.
    3. Within 30 seconds, all three of them accidentally kill themselves.
- During the space walk back to his shuttle, why did he rocket himself towards it so fast that he painfully bounced off of it several times? I couldn't help but laugh when that happened.
- Why did he use the nuke to propel himself home? It was never established that there was any kind of fuel shortage for the mission, and that seems insanely risky.",movies,"I did not enjoy Ad Astra.

* *Let the sky fall / When it crumbles / We will stand tall / Face it all together / At skyfall*: After the bombing of MI6, the sky is falling per se for Bond and M. They will work together to stop the villain, ultimately bringing them to Bond's childhood home of Skyfall.
* *You may have my number, you can take my name / But you'll never have my heart:* Bond is loyal to M, but will always have a fraught personal relationship with her. 
* *Where you go I go / What you see I see / I know I'd never be me / Without the security / Of your loving arms / Keeping me from harm:* Bond is under M's care, for better or worse. Points out the irony of Bond getting hit by the risky gunshot at the beginning of the film that M authorized.
* *Put your hand in my hand / And we'll stand:* A reference to the showdown at Skyfall at the end of the film. Regardless of what happens and his feelings, Bond still pledges to stand by M's side.

130,"Her (2013) - A film I wanted to watch, and I still do after watching it","First and foremost - what an incredible film. 


After hearing the relationship between Lost in Translation and this movie, I wanted to watch this. Apparently it's two sides of the same story, and since Lost in Translation is my current favourite movie, I felt like I had to. 


But just saying it's a movie made solely for Jonze to redeem himself after Sofia Coppola's ""accusation"" of him being a boring dorky man in Lost in Translation, that would do the movie no justice. 


The movie revolves around Theodore Twombly looking for a restart of his life after a break-up that got him all teared up. He finds comfort in an Operating System (OS), a revolutionary AI to accompany people in their daily lives. His OS calls herself Samantha, and it doesn't take long until their relationship surpasses a simply professional one.


First of all I was charmed by the use of colour in this movie; above all, the colour red. It's omnipresent throughout the scenes and it will stay with me as an immediate association I have with that colour for sure.      
The cinematography, and I know it's cliché to talk about it, is gorgeous. I've never felt like wanting a different camera perspective in any scene.      
I haven't seen any other movie starring Joaquin Phoenix, so for me this actor is still fresh. I could not compare it to another movie. But what an actor he is - not only did I feel for Theodore, I want to go as far as saying I wish I was a friend of his. 
Then there is Scarlett, who is almost as powerful as she was in Lost in Translation but without actually appearing on screen. She is the only thing in the movie that reminds me Lost in Translation and Her are related in a way. That does not take away any enjoyment, though.        
The story is so neatly pieced together, completely based on one concept: when are computers more than just computers? After all, we humans also think in 1's and 0's, and so do they. Computers are the children of humanity, and children should grow up to surpass their parents, shouldn't they? But at the same time, can we stand the thought of us human beings having deep emotional connection to something that's - in a sense - not-human at all, and should it be viewed as a kind of bestiality? The subject this film touches on set me to think a lot. I recently read the collection of stories by Asimov, I, Robot, that are all about the human-computer relationship. The feelings I got from the book and this movie were very similar and that's a compliment for Spike Jonze, that he took matters and worked them out as deeply as the late Asimov did, an icon in science-fiction.         
But eventually it all comes down to being a beautiful love story, and I don't mean that as a bad thing. You root for Samantha and Theo just as much as you root for any other couple in a romance movie. Maybe even more because both get so much more dimension than your average rom-com roles. Samantha and Theo do have something special together, how unlikely that seems if you look at the nature of their relationship on it's surface.         
Yes, the movie can be slow at times, with parts that are just music-driven slideshows of Theodore walking around without any plot-progression, but if you are a fan of character-driven movies you will not find that an issue as every shot of Theodore makes him slightly more likable, every sound of Samantha's voice makes her a bit more real, and every shot of their surroundings increases your understanding in what kind of a world they live in - a world not that different from ours. 


The film is a must-watch for any fan of romance. It did leave me with a few questions that I might be able to answer after a second viewing - I won't discuss them here, though, because they would spoil a lot of the movie.


I'm pretty sure r/movies hates people admiring the same movies over and over and I know how much love there is for this movie on here - but I just wanted to put my thoughts onto paper and I thought I'd review it, because I'm full of it. I did not cry, unfortunately, and I felt like at times I could've if I tried to, but I guess it wasn't terrible enough of a day for rain.


I'm not sure yet if I prefer to watch this over Lost in Translation. The latter is a lot easier to watch and doesn't get as vulgar as Her, but at the same time doesn't dip as deep in the pool or take me on such an amazing trip. I like both movies a lot and would recommend both of them to anyone.

But at the same time, can we stand the thought of us human beings having deep emotional connection to something that's - in a sense - not-human at all, and should it be viewed as a kind of bestiality? The subject this film touches on set me to think a lot. I recently read the collection of stories by Asimov, I, Robot, that are all about the human-computer relationship. The feelings I got from the book and this movie were very similar and that's a compliment for Spike Jonze, that he took matters and worked them out as deeply as the late Asimov did, an icon in science-fiction.         
But eventually it all comes down to being a beautiful love story, and I don't mean that as a bad thing. You root for Samantha and Theo just as much as you root for any other couple in a romance movie. Maybe even more because both get so much more dimension than your average rom-com roles. Samantha and Theo do have something special together, how unlikely that seems if you look at the nature of their relationship on it's surface.         
Yes, the movie can be slow at times, with parts that are just music-driven slideshows of Theodore walking around without any plot-progression, but if you are a fan of character-driven movies you will not find that an issue as every shot of Theodore makes him slightly more likable, every sound of Samantha's voice makes her a bit more real, and every shot of their surroundings increases your understanding in what kind of a world they live in - a world not that different from ours. 


The film is a must-watch for any fan of romance. It did leave me with a few questions that I might be able to answer after a second viewing - I won't discuss them here, though, because they would spoil a lot of the movie.


I'm pretty sure r/movies hates people admiring the same movies over and over and I know how much love there is for this movie on here - but I just wanted to put my thoughts onto paper and I thought I'd review it, because I'm full of it. I did not cry, unfortunately, and I felt like at times I could've if I tried to, but I guess it wasn't terrible enough of a day for rain.


I'm not sure yet if I prefer to watch this over Lost in Translation. The latter is a lot easier to watch and doesn't get as vulgar as Her, but at the same time doesn't dip as deep in the pool or take me on such an amazing trip. I like both movies a lot and would recommend both of them to anyone. Thanks for reading!",1

141,Entertainment (2015),"Saw a recent On Cinema episode, looked up a Tim Heidecker interview about Mister America, then fell down a Rick Alverson rabbit hole and borrowed Entertainment (2015) from the internet because I sorta enjoyed The Comedy (2012).  Has anybody else seen Entertainment?  I need to talk.

I think I hated this movie.

Endless stunning shots of landscapes and interesting dirty interiors and pretty much no story of any kind.  Every single opportunity to build turning points in a scene, much less to build a sequence of related scenes to a multi-scene crescendo, is squandered as they move onto the next event.  Michael Cera shows up, there's a great suspenseful build-up to something, then  nothing happens.

Turkington's cousin is a well-meaning dickhead, we build and build on that, and then nothing comes of it.

He leaves a thousand voicemails for his daughter, and that's never paid off in any way.

His flagrantly unfunny opening act takes off his shoes, acting compellingly like a son toward Turkington, then that relationship is never mentioned or furthered.

A woman attacks him outside a bar with no effect on any other part of the film.

In good film, scenes exist for a reason.  Characters enter a scene with one emotional tone and leave with another.  One scene motivates characters further into a sequence (a set of related scenes) that pays off several scenes down the line.  Characters come into a situation with a certain intent but turning points send them in a direction they never expected.  In Entertainment, our protagonist refuses to take action at every turn and the most emotional scene in the movie, his last performance, has no effect on any other scene.  What the hell, Alverson?

155,1001 List Review: West Side Story,"West Side Story 1961

So I’m taking a mini retirement and decided to add yet another movie review post no one asked for to the list. During my weeks/months of time away from work, I'm aiming to watch one movie a day from the list of [1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/1001+movies+you+must+see+before+you+die/). I’m mostly doing the write-ups to keep myself mentally engaged and from doing literally nothing all day, which is my true heart’s desire. I’m an accountant by trade (no really) so my opinions are beyond unqualified. Feel free to disagree, you’ll probably educate me.

Plot Synopsis:

A musical in which a modern day Romeo and Juliet are involved in New York street gangs. On the harsh streets of the upper west side, two gangs battle for control of the turf. The situation becomes complicated when a gang members falls in love with a rival's sister.

[https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-film-classic-3o7aTm3qSAdSfwzVkY](https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-film-classic-3o7aTm3qSAdSfwzVkY)

My Take:

The story follows Tony and Maria, star-crossed lovers who meet at a 50’s dance but cannot be together because of Maria’s brother’s grudge against Tony’s former gang, the Jets. Maria’s brother, Bernardo, is the leader of the rival gang the Sharks. The actual plot plays out just as tawdry and melodramatic as real Romeo and Juliet feels nowadays. From my skimming Wikipedia the music pushed a lot of boundaries at the time and for the most part it’s pretty excellent and kept me engaged with the movie, despite how cheesy everything is. Most of the characters are much better dancers than actors; I assume that is due to the fact it was seen as a musical first and not because, say, acting wasn’t invented yet or something. An exception is Rita Moreno, who is pretty darn good at both. She won an academy award so someone 60 years ago agreed with me on that. That being said everyone that sings that aren’t the main two range from “okay” to “kill me”.

Altogether it was a really fun experience of theater translated to film, except for the schlocky parts. But even then it was definitely worth watching and experiencing. No regrets.

Context:

Billboard Hot 100 number-one single at the time was [Hit the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8Tiz6INF7I) Jack by Ray Charles, which goes to show popular musical taste at the time. It makes sense why the music in the play could have been thought of as too challenging.The play premiered during times of rising gang violence, which probably helped it stay relevant. [Brown vs Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) took place three years prior which probably helped inform the themes of “Us vs Them” racial tension, even though the Sharks are Puerto Rican, not Black. Number one film that year was this one.

160,High Life (2018) vs. Prospect (2018),"These two films have narrative and structural similarities in that they are both set in remote space, and have central protagonists who are a father/daughter duet, but couldn’t be more different in execution and  film-making philosophy. 

Both are low-budget indie love-childs of their respective directors (Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell for Prospect and Claire Denis for High-Life). But High-Life is French High-Brow Neo-MindF*ckery while Prospect is more Retro Sci-Fi Western world-building. 

While I enjoyed the performances of the lead actors in both (Robert Pattinson in High Life and Pedro Pascal in Prospect) I couldn’t help but be almost offended by the contempt for audience that High-Life displays with its disorienting and meandering “plot.” Prospect, on the other hand, takes the audience through the directors’ vision with carefully dispersed revelation that is digestible and enjoyable.

So, apparently the original director was a giant ass and got fired. He would shoot scenes without even thinking about where the CGI animals would be. He would get mad at everything preproduction. Get mad at editors and VFX guys for his mistakes and ignorance. That's why the TMNT director did the reshoots.

164,"Desperately need help finding a movie that appears to have never existed. If anyone has seen it, it’s one of you. Please help!","Last fall my BF and I watched a horror flick that we *cannot find* anywhere, on any platform, no matter what keywords we use. We’ve both spent literally hours dredging the internet and as we don’t know the title, we cannot find the movie anywhere. I’ll describe it below as best I can remember in hopes that someone will recognize it and know the name! 

First and foremost- it is entirely first person POV. Not found footage! It as if the camera is just stuck in the main character’s head and it never moves. 

The main character is a young woman on summer break from college in her sleepy home town. She meets up with two friends, a guy and a girl, and they smoke pot in the woods. It is the Fourth of July, or at least there is a fireworks celebration that night. Lots of POV shots of her cellphone in her hand. 

They go to the celebration and during the fireworks it is announced that a young girl is missing, and there’s some kind of curfew, so they make home. They stop at a party and drink, eventually she ends up home. The killer is inside her house and the first of many many scuffles ensues. I think at this point she’s texting her brother to stay away. She runs to a neighbors house and then out into the town. 

In the final 20 minutes or so, in running from the killer, she is hit by a car. The killer starts chasing her again and she runs into a gas station, and he follows. Shots were fired? Possibly? Either way the movie ends with her stabbing the shit out of the killer as the police blast into the gas station yelling to have her hands up. Again, all 100% POV and not in the found footage sort of way. 

If you know what movie I’m talking about you will save both my BF and I from assuming we had a dual hallucination for 90 minutes roughly a year ago and now we’re going crazy.

170,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil," CGI action is a plague on this movie, as it descends slowly down the spiral to an MCU style 'big finish' battle. Much money was spent on it no doubt, but watching it you find yourself asking 'why?'.

Why has hollywood not realised we are collectively bored of this yet? Seriously,  when action sequences go on for minutes, and zero sense of threat or weight is present because cgi still doesn't look or move correctly, it's  time to realise not every blockbuster needs to ape Marvel/Disney. One punch that looks like it really lands and HAS EFFECT is worth inifinitely more than twenty or hundred punches that seemingly do nothing at all, except make noise and particle effects.

Having rewatched the LOTR films again recently, these films are in  many ways what set the ball rolling on the CGI tedium - consider (if you  remember) how good the action is, and how 'meaty' it feels in the FIRST  film. By the time we get to the third 'technology and budget' had  improved, yet the action is considerably more boring... - less real  world choreography, more sprites and pixels.",movies,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil  CGI action is a plague on this movie, as it descends slowly down the spiral to an MCU style 'big finish' battle.

181,Where parodies went wrong. It is not about pop culture. It is about telling a story.,"I am as of right now watching Dracula Dead and Loving it and it reminds me of the practically dead genre of parody movies.

After Scary Movie 2, parody films became about how many pop culture references one can cram into a single movie. The movies became less about telling a cohesive story and more about ""Hey look! Remember this!? That is why it is funny! Because you remember this!"".

These jokes usually broke the film's pacing, style, and genre. Like in one of these films spoofing a part of Narnia, it suddenly became a hiphop song mimicking MTV's cribs. 

These got worse and worse as the films went on. It was all about mocking pop culture trends or long dead viral videos than it was about the primary film they were making fun on.

Taking the master of parody Mel Brooks; all his movies served as an actual storyline.  They all had a plotline with 3 proper acts with actual conflict and resolution.

The humor came from the characters' behavior and dialogue. Such as when Dracula tells the Usher to give a message to Dr Steward. But judt before she does so, he tells her that she will forget everything.

Comedy follows esp her delivery of 'No Tip!?'. The physical humor is not just 'fat guy falls down' but all with great timing and purpose. 

Men in tights has Robin playing the straight man in a world of goofs (never dumb or derpy. Just almost cartoony with their logic).

And of course you have AIRPLANE! Who matches all of these elements then combines it with fantastic background humor, witty and wonderful wordplay, and straight deliveries to absurb situations.

Even Cabin in the Woods plays it straight while providing humor on the mocking of horror tropes. My favorite being ""we should stick together...""

""No...let's split up instead...""

190,What are some of your favorite movies that not a lot of people like or know about,"My favorite movie if all time is easily Speed Racer from 2008. I first watched it as a kid, so basically any movie I watched was good to me, but I've also seen it 5 times since then and it still holds up. Everything about it is super exaggerated and I love it. The bright colors, the cheesy lines, the very obvious bad guys vs good guys, the super powered cars. I didn't even know until 2018 that it was based off an amine show, and now I love it even more. Now it's not only my favorite movie of all time it's also my favorite adaptation. Not to mention I had all of the Lego sets for it as well, and I spent all of my own money on that.

The disappointing thing about it is I feel like it wasn't very popular, with only 40% on rotten tomatoes. I don't often see people defending it either.

201,Can Anyone Tell Me the Name of Obscure Netflix Horror Movie...,"Google has turned up nothing and I've been searching for a while now. I saw it within the last few months but it isn't showing up in my watched titles and it's driving me crazy. 

So it's a movie that is a collection of short horror films, each one introduced by a short blurb with the background or origin of the tale. It's like the backstory for different cultures' legends or myths. The first one is super beautiful and is about two young German women, one brunette and one blonde, who see each other in the woods on the way to the creek to wash clothes with other women from the village. The young blonde is apparently pregnant, and the woman of the village seem to be gossiping about it because she appears unmarried (there is very little dialogue in this one, adding to the quiet unsettling vibe). The brunette ends up sneaking off into the woods to spend time with the blonde and gives her her blood-stained clothes to wash in the river so the women don't suspect the blonde of being pregnant anymore. They end up kissing and being spotted by the brunette's superstitious mother, who then makes her pray to some sort of effigy in the woods to not be gay/ possessed.  The brunette ends up having hallucinations/ nightmares about her mother being possessed, instead, and dreams of killing her (if I remember that part correctly?). She seems like she's losing her mind a little bit, not sleeping/ seeing things etc. Her and the blonde continue to meet up and frolic in the sylvan setting and the brunette basically accepts that she's gay/possessed and fast forward to her walking naked into the woods, fully embracing the demonic nature of things. Maybe she killed her mom, I don't quite remember.

Another short was a bunch of drunken Mediterranean men frolicking in, like, Krampus/ demon costumes for some holiday where the veil is thin. A demon comes to check them out in a hooded costume and the men end up finding him out and capturing him, making fun of the demon and abusing him a little bit. I think they make him show them the entrance to hell he crawled out of, and they just get drunker and rowdier the whole way there. There may be a boat they use to cross a body of water, using torches to light their way. I think one of the men ends up going through the gate to the underworld and it possibly shows him wandering by himself into a reddened sort of vague tunnel.

Aaaaaaaaaaand there is also a short (I think it was black and white?) where a man is walking through what looks like a forest, but he's walking around about 6 feet under the ground in a series of passageways. There he encounters a legit crazy woman who tells him he needs to eat 3 fresh-ish hearts and she'll grant him a wish or powers or something. The dude is all for it so when he sees someone get buried he waits and then digs up the corpse and busts out the heart (no easy feat, those ribs are tough) and mows down. Obviously this one is pretty graphic. He then finds like a small kid, and robs that grave, and a woman. I feel like the kid/ baby was the most difficult to watch. The woman in white appears (not quite a ghost because I think you can see her feet and she flails around in some strange trance/ dance) and actually I think she's his last victim. I feel like he killed her and then ate her heart and gained the powers she promised him. I forget how this one ended-- I know the authorities were investigating the plundered graves and hunting him down.

212,The Best Massive Battle - The Battle of the Helm's Deep?," I had a discussion with a friend of mine about massive battles seen in recent cinema. We were trying to name the best ones that make sense in their own universe and that are executet well. After going through a lot of battles from different genres (Sci Fi, History, Fanatasy) we both decided that the Hem's Deep was our favorite. The runner up was Kingdom of Heaven because it at least tried to show a historical siege and events during that battle made sense (it's not 100% accurate but I found it good enough).

The reason for choosing Helm's Deep is that the battle is just well rounded up without being 30 minutes of mindless slaughter. The pace is great, the timing of events is just superb to keep you on the edge and give you goosebumps. The last charge of Aragorn and Theoden is just full of emotions and makes sense considering their situtation.

It might be that I'm biased because I grew up reading LotR but those are just my two cents.

218,To the people complaining about a non-white Catwoman,"https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Maria_Kyle_(New_Earth)

You people realize that Catwoman is biracial right? In the comics, she is the daughter of a white father and a Latina immigrant mother from Cuba named Maria Kyle. Catwoman's real name is also Selina Kyle, which is a latin name.

I know Zoe Kravitz isn't Latina, but so many people seem royally convinced that Catwoman is some fully Caucasian character, which is objectively false. She's been biracial ever since her parentage was revealed decades ago. People just don't know about it because her origins aren't explored as often as other characters.

She's only fully white when there's a fully white actress in the role.",movies,"To the people complaining about a non-white Catwoman https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Maria_Kyle_(New_Earth)

222,"Which Are Your Top 3 Favorite Horror Films Of All Time? And If You Want, You Can Explain Why Do You Enjoy Them.","We are close to Halloween so let's mention our favorite horror movies. My favorite horror movies are:

1. 
Perfect Blue (1997). It haves some of the best transitions I've seen in film which not only gives the film more style but also deliver information, show passage of time and also confuse you like the female protagonist and express her losing sense of time and reality, amazing attention to detail, talks about a lot of subjects that are still very relevant today and do connect to each other in some ways, some great clues, a great twist and some fairly interesting characters that also serve for the themes of the film. I also love how it plays with the idea of fantasy-reality and also describing what Mima is going through her life through the film as it shows a amazing way of breaking the 4th wall, comments on many things at the same time and tell the events occuring in the film, the protagonist's development, etc. The animation, while not perfect, is quite beautiful and makes the psychological horror feel more grounded and that more terrifying. It's also one of those you can watch everytime and learn something new from it. It is my 4th favorite film of all time and my favorite anime/animated film. Though, while I would say it's a pretty disturbing film, I find it more fascinating than disturbing. It's a great must-watch-multiple-times film. It does have some pretty surrealistic-like moments but it isn't supernatural at all but rather, it is psychological and it is very grounded in its horror. It also talks about many subjects and themes that are still very complex like the male gaze, identity, sexuality, fanaticism, mental illness, pressure, the movie/pop industry, the desire of living in the past, etc. They are all connected in some way and are explored in great depth. It's one of the most layered films I've ever seen.

2. 
American Psycho (2000). It's one of the most hilarious movies of all time, in my opinion. It is also very well-written, talks about a lot of nice subjects like the idea of consumerism, identity, conformity, self-worth, greed, the problems of capitalism, the shallowness of the 80's culture, and other social issues. It's also a disturbing movie despite its comedic tone. Christian Bale does one of the best performances for a villian and the villian Bale is playing is already a pretty fascinating character. Patrick Bateman is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time. His performance is not just super entertaining and expressive but it really serves on communicating of what the character is about and surprisingly, despite being over-the-top, there are actually some great subtleties to his performance. Not to mention that a lot of the movie is pretty quotable and memorable. I also just love the big irony of some of its scenes (like in the hookers scene where he talks about how much he loves a song for addressing the problems of abusive political authority when he is basically just doing that with them) and how over-the-top it is over such small things like the business card scene, which not only serves to be very funny but it helps on communicating just how shallow and ridiculous these men are and to show how Bateman really tries too hard on proving himself on having a better business card despite the business cards not looking all that different and also that the idea of business cards looking not much different also serves into communicating another theme/message of the film where other people confuse others for other people due to their self-indulgence.

I also really like the cinematography as it does really express that 80's feel to it and it does look ""nice, very nice"". The business card being especially well-directed and the first monologue scene having the perfect presentation as by giving it this feel of a beauty commercial, it exemplifies the themes of materialism and superficiality in the movie.

It's a pretty fun and smart movie. My favorite satire of all time. Sure, it is unrealistic and absurd but that's the point of the film and it is not exactly trying to be realistic. It is exagerrated but still making a good point with its judgement of capitalism and also making it fitting with its comedic, absurdist tone.

But if they were to take a creature from say an African culture and the casting were reversed, there would be backlash from those same people.","First off, I admit I was initially unhappy with the differing race casting of Ariel when I assumed they would be recreating the animated story that takes place off the coast of Denmark. Once they announced the story's setting is being changed to the Caribbean, the casting choice doesn't feel so out of place, and they are clearly deviating from the animated film so they should be able to cast whoever.

However, with searching through the unpopular opinions dealing with movie casting in regards to race/ethnicity, one of the biggest arguments I see a lot in regards to the Ariel black casting is that Ariel is a mermaid, a mythical creature built in folk-tale that is arguably entirely fiction. And even though the fairy-tale Disney based their animated movie off of is Danish, it doesn't matter what race she is because she's not a real, human character right? However, I feel that if Hollywood were to take a myth/legend/folk-tale from native African culture and change the characters to be white (or any other race), the same people that were arguing Ariel can be any race would throw their hands up in anger for suddenly ""white-washing"" a character, even if it fits that same criteria of Ariel for being a fictional, mythical creature.

I'll give an example. In the legends of the Ewe people of Ghana and Togo, there is a mythical creature known as the Adze. The Adze is a sort of ""vampire"" if you will that takes the form of a firefly. Upon capturing an Adze it will revert to a human-like form and attack. If Hollywood were to make a movie in Africa, depicting the Adze, people would most likely argue that the Adze should be played by a black person. But if we use the same argument that was used for Ariel, they should be able to cast whoever they want for the role based on acting prowess. As a person of Asian descent myself, if they were to say cast an Asian person for the Adze, I wouldn't feel empowered or more represented in the film industry. I would feel confused as to why they were changing a folk-lore just to pander to my people.

To roundabout what I initially said about my opinion on the Ariel casting. If they were to make a movie about the Adze and set it in Africa, I would prefer they stick to setting and cast a person of African descent. However I would be fine if they were to relocate the story to say, Norway and depict/cast the Adze as a white person.",movies,"People are dismissing the Ariel casting because it's myth/folktale/legend so they should be able to cast whomever they choose.

251,A Walk in the Woods (2015),"I have been a fan of Bill Bryson for a many years even since I read ""Notes from a Big Country"", I then read his book about England, Australia, The Woods and eventually the Universe but the one that stuck for me more than any was ""A Walk in The Woods"", something about the idea of walking the AT in the US sounds real exciting and romantic though I appreciate it is very much very far from that for people who do it and the romantic idea goes downhill (no pun intended) quickly.

So when I heard they were making a book based his novel A Walk in The Woods I really wanted to see it. I cannot claim to know much about Robert Redford (playing Bryson) or or that matter Nick Nolte (playing Katz) but I still wondered if they could pull it off. Redford was not how I imagined Bryson but to his credit he was good and given that almost no-one outside of Iowa knows Katz I had no clue what to expect but both I really enjoyed. There were bits in the film that were not in the book but I guess they had artistic licence and there was a a lot in the book missed in the film but given the length of the book and the time period it was written over this was to be expected.

I don't think this film will ever be that remembered. I am not sure AWITW is even Bryons best selling novel but as a film to capture a moment with stunning scenery, wonderful dialogue and a reminder that we can achieve things if only we are willing to try I think this is wonderful.

252,Opinion: The Addams Family (2019) has the WORST character designs I have ever seen in an animated movie,"I have not seen the actual movie yet, but based on the promos and posters and ads, it it some of the worst I’ve ever seen. The characters look horrendous to where there’s no excuse for them to look that bad. Yes I know they’re supposed to be weird and creepy, but look at Tim Burton’s animated designs: they are deformed and usually undead characters yet they are visually appealing (and in the case of Frankenweenie, down right cute). How the hell did Wednesday “Q Tip Head” Addams get past the design stage? The cold dead eyes of all the characters don’t help anything either.

Edit: I am well aware that’s how they looked in the comics, I just personally think they could have done something different in terms of a 3D character. SpongeBob works great in 2D, but once it goes to 3D, (Sponge Out of Water) it just does not work for me and looks sort of creepy.

257,Which movie changed the way action scenes are choreographed and filmed?,"I’ve recently been revisiting all the Bond movies and have really been enjoying how action has evolved over the years in film. When jumping from the last Brosnan to the first Craig film, there is a significant change in the way the action is choreographed and filmed. 

Die Another Day came out in 2002 and Casino Royale in 2006. They only films I can think of that may have been the cause for change is The Bourne Identity (2002) and Bourne Supremacy (2004). I think it’s crazy that both Die Another Day and the Bourne Identity came out in the same year when the action sequences are so different from each other, it feels like they came out in different decades. The Bourne fights feel so much more real than those last Brosnan films.

270,Blade Runner 2049s story is too big and kinda messy,"The biggest mistake of 2049 imho was to make Deckard and its people more important than he actually ever was:

In the first movie he is just some random Film Noir detective that met the love of his live, got caught up in the bigger events, survived a showdown with a foe, discovered some truth about himself in the process and maybe got to live happily ever after. 

The story of him and Rachel on the run could have been a sequel but wasnt necessary.

Instead 2049 made them both into Robot Joseph and Mary giving magical birth to Replicant Female Jesus .

Also blowing up the whole Replicant theme way up than it ever needed to be. And it completely changed the overall tone of the universe.

Blad Runner's magic lies in its compactness, its a Film Noir Crime Story and the Universe hovers above it all, too big and awesome to ever be changed or effected by its events.

The whole Resistance anf big time war looming thing just didnt seem right. It kinda reminded me of Matrix Revolutions. Lifting the curtain too much and taking away the magic and mystery of the universe.

The story just gives Deckard way too much importance in the overall world than he ever had. Nobody in the first movie was ever that special really. It was just lonely characters that found some spark of love and met their fate in a dark and gritty LA  .

It was just a tight Film Noir story that also raised some deep philosophical questions.

The biggest strength of 2049 was probably its love story between K and Joi and I think they could have made a whole movie about just that. It would have been a much smaller movie but probably a better one.",movies,"Blade Runner 2049s story is too big and kinda messy The biggest mistake of 2049 imho was to make Deckard and its people more important than he actually ever was:

271,Fractured ( Netflix film),"Is not the greatest suspense movie of all time but it does the job to entertain you and make you wonder if your theory is the real one. It's in fact a little bit predictable but as i said before until the end you can't be 100% sure that is what you thought, the ending explains too much it would have been better if they had left us in doubt about what happened, but its not bad at all.

281,About Time: A glorious disaster for a new father,"Hello reddit,

I know at this point I’m probably screaming into the void. I finally got around to watching this movie. I’d seen roughly what it was about and was interested, but never got around to it. I finally found the time (ironic) to watch it and it borderline broke me. 

If you’ve had a reasonably strong relationship with your father this movie will easily tug at your heart strings. If you are a new father (maybe even a little too angry at the world and what it’s become or what you’ve failed to become) it is particularly poignant. 

I don’t really have much of a point to any of this as I type through blurry and teary eyes, but if you haven’t seen it, I’d give it a go. It doesn’t break ground, but its simplicity is beautiful. And it makes you re-evaluate what you have and what’s worth fighting for. Anyways, I enjoyed it, and I hope you do too. If not that’s also cool. Take care.",movies,"About Time: A glorious disaster for a new father Hello reddit,

Actually, comedies very seldom make me laugh too but I digress. 
I may get shit for this but the last scary movie I saw that even got my heart rate up was the first Paranormal Activity believe it or not. So I’m asking for some recommendations.

- The Descent",movies,"Recommend a movie that’ll scare the ever-loving fuck out of me This is not a brag because bragging about such a thing would be pretty pathetic, but practically no movies ever scare me.

Actually, comedies very seldom make me laugh too but I digress. 
I may get shit for this but the last scary movie I saw that even got my heart rate up was the first Paranormal Activity believe it or not. So I’m asking for some recommendations.

305,About Midsommar...,"So to start things, I'm always itching for a good horror film. Sadly those are so few and far between.

Midsommar was something else. Great visuals. Great atmosphere. Amazing acting. Holy hell at that opening.

But with all that said, my god the character writing was bad. It felt like straight up 70s/80s/90s cheeseball horror. Idiot kids making idiot calls. Witness a suicide and then a straight up murder? Nah it's fine. It's just these people's way of life. Totally cool. Let's stick around. Friends start vanishing after knowing these people are capable of murder? Oh it doesn't really matter. Hell one of the main characters literally says, ""We don't associate as friends of his,"" when his buddy vanishes. Like dude no one is going to give a shit about a thesis when literally two of their friends have gone missing along with another couple. There is no fucking way anyone in their right mind would feel comfortable being an outsider among 20+ pagan people that are fine witnessing and inflicting human loss.

The movie builds such a tense atmosphere but every time a character decision is made I feel the urge to face palm. This is not how real people react to traumatic events. I would argue the only characters that seemed to act competently were the British couple that were murdered. Even then a rational mind would have never bought the whole ""your boyfriend already left without you"" claim and gone off with the cult. This is a red flag. The characters even hear the girl scream and make nothing of it. What was the point?

Then there's the cult. They're shown to be murderers, manipulators, and liars. So my question is why do they keep the farce going for so long? When the final arc begins the only two remaining people are Christian and Dani. The final day begins with the cultists lying about their sacred book to cover up the deaths of Josh and Mark. But why? Literally moments later they start the rituals and murder Christian. What the hell was the point of this? Why not drug the fuckers during breakfast? Why bother if they had the paralyzing agent to begin with?

Again, great atmosphere and acting, but jeez was it disappointing to get the same old incompetent protagonists. Also what the fuck was the point of the guy wearing Mark's skin? Like that was at night and didn't seem to have anything to do with the rituals. Pure shock value? It reminds of a scene from another overall great horror film-- It Follows. In that movie, the creature is said to constantly move towards its target. However there is one weird scene where it just stands on a roof as a naked man. This scene made no sense in the context of the story and felt like a shock value insertion.

Anyway, great atmosphere. Great acting. Bad writing.

331,What are the best great movies trapped inside of bad movies?,"What are some movies that could have been great, but ultimately are killed because of some bad choices?

My favorite example has to be Clash of the Titans (2010). The movie as it exists feels rushed and poorly executed with totally shallow characters, but it has decent acting, amazing practical effects, and mostly good CGI. I think that the script was cut down significantly in production, and if the movie had been extended from ~1hr 30min to a more natural ~2hr 30min to 3hr running time with more breathing room between action scenes to get to know the characters, the movie could have been genuinely amazing. It almost hurts to watch because you can feel the good movie trapped under this bad one.

333,The Addams Family *SNAP* *SNAP* Review (2019),"SPOILERS!

I'm not the biggest fan of this series, I've barley watched the original, so keep that in mind when reading. I did however watch a high-school theater production of it, and I can say it was better than this movie. The Addams Family (2019) is about the Addams family and their day-to-day life, until Wednesday wants to be different from the family, and Pugsley starts to study to become a real ""Addams"" man. 

The story itself is weird. It revolves a lot over real estate, something I wouldn't want in a kid's horror film. It also shows some signs of ""oh everyone's too attached to their phones these days"" through the plot. At one point people attack the Addams with actual torches. 13 years later in the story, their being attacked with torches ... from their phones. They also try to spread gossip through social media, but it doesn't effect the Addams so I didn't see the point in it.

The animation is mediocre overall, nothing stands out. But the characters, OH GEEZ do they suck. Everyone looks horrible, the normal humans more than the ACTUAL monsters. It's mostly because of their noses. Instead of making every character have their own personality and character traits, they made every character have a distinct nose, aaaand it stinks. It really makes their whole face look hideous. Their waists are also weird. Most women have SUPER tight waists, and all the men are fat.

Character traits are also bad. The most outgoing trait was when one character turns emo, and for a moment I thought we went back to 2009. A Little off topic, this same character then exposes the antagonist through the ""ooooo I got u on camera"" cliche. Problem is, she said it was shown to 3 MILLION people, and never before did we see this type of  social media status through the movie.

The writing is dull. The only good written character was Wednesday. The jokes also fall flat, besides for one. At the end Gomez's brother oddly marries the antagonist (it's really weird. First he rides off into the background with her talking about real estate, and the next scene has them married). The joke in question is when he said ""I can't believe me, an absolute 0 got to be with you, also a 0."" That did get me to chuckle.

The beginning was nice and also was the climax and falling action. My favorite part was when they remade the original theme. Which brings me into the next part, the music. It's BAD. Nothing was memorable besides the main theme, and that was only memorable because they didn't change it. They did do a remix at the end, but it's nothing to ride home about.

A good thing about the movie was the moral, it's to stand out from others and be different (I guess they didn't list to their own movie). It's what every other PG animated movie does these days, but I thought it was OK. But that's why my final rating for this movie is a lazy TV sitcom out of 10.

The animation is bad, the music is bad, the story is bad, and the writing is mediocre, but the moral is fine. It also uses nostalgia to get money. If you really wanted to see this, I would wait until it goes on Netfilx/Hulu/YoutubeTV. It's not worth your money. If you could, I would recommend seeing a high-school theater play, or watching the Original. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed this movie more than I did, if you did happen to see it.",movies,"The Addams Family *SNAP* *SNAP* Review (2019) SPOILERS!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm aware of the new wave of criticism of the movie but I personally still love it, and am interested to hear from those who still love it why they do. Personally, one of my top reasons is its poignant reminder that no one (save maybe our parents?) can give us the certainty of eternal love:

**Tom: ""I need to know that you're not gonna wake up in the morning and feel differently.""**

**Summer: ""And I can't give you that. Nobody can.""**

Was going through my first breakup when i first watched the movie and those lines really hit home. I felt the movie portrayed heartbreak so relatably and realistically (eg the non-linear nature of memory when looking back at a relationship, the epiphany that you can't hold anyone accountable for your emotions, etc)",movies,"What makes you love 500 Days of Summer?

349,"Which is your favorite ""hyperlink cinema"" film?","By this, I am asking which movie is your favorite that focuses on different stories that do connect/interact in some way. For example, the film later releaving a character from the 1st story does get to see or meet the character from the 3rd story and maybe their interaction causes something to happen in their story. Do not confuse this for a anthology movie, which is seperate films/stories put together into 1 movie.

For me, that would be Sin City (2005). This is my favorite comic book film ever.

The presentation is absolutely fantastic. It's unique, creative, well-shot, well-lit, and perfectly captures that feel of a comic book story. I also really love the use of silhouettes in the movie. It haves among my favorite visuals in any film. I just love the whole style of this movie. The characters are also very interesting, well-designed and have interesting stories that keep you hooked. Also, that cannibal killer antagonist is just fucking terrifying. I think he gave my favorite performance in this film. The performance and the presentation really portrayed how evil this man is. The dialogue is also very fun and memorable. Sure, it's super blunt, cheesy and edgy but intentionally so as it is playing with the noir style. Some of the visuals (mainly the clearly CGI cars) look laughable but I find it acceptable as the story is supposed to be cartoonish and over-the-top with its presentation and stories, which I think it succeeded pretty well.

I’m a freshman in college who’s living away from my strict parents for the first time (yknow... had to ask before watching a PG-13 movie until after my 17th birthday type strict). Now that I’m out of their house, I can watch pretty much whatever I want. I’ve been wanting to catch up on popular movies for a few years now and have a pretty decent list of ones I want to watch. There’s a small problem though. 

Due to a really fucked up experience in high school, the sight or sound of knives being honed/sharpened makes me puke and have a panic attack. This is a sound that isn’t uncommon in action/horror movies (and sometimes random other ones, I recently watched an indie kids movie that featured it and was Not Okay for a few hours lmao) and if I hear/see it unexpectedly I’ll be having a real bad time really quickly— but it’s not like the MPAA puts “knives being sharpened” along with the warnings for sex and graphic violence. Was wondering if any movie buffs could let me know which of these films contained the sound so I know to avoid them, or at least mentally prepare myself before watching.

371,Has anyone begun to notice the same patterns in movies and developed the habit of not wanting to watch one unless it has a good rating?,"I used to enjoy literally any movie without the need to know its rating or reviews. But lately, I started to feel that a movie isn't worth watching unless it has good reviews. 

The reason for this is because I started to notice that the plots of most movies nowadays usually fall into the same fixed patterns. For example, literally any action movie starring The Rock starts with the 'initial fighting scene', then follows by some dialogues or explanation regarding the situations (usually there is some mission that seems impossible to carry out), then a failed attempt 'fighting scene' regarding the mission, and finally 'the final fighting scene' that successfully finish the mission at antagonist's main base. Any action movie under 7.0 imdb rating follows this pattern.

Other genres too have their own fixed patterns. For example, a zombie or apocalypse movie would have this exact same plot. The root of the virus, non critical spread to a nearby town, then the serious situation where everybody in the city dies, then some actions of protagonists trying to resolve or escape the thing, and finally the ending where they eventually find a small survival community.

I know that they are still many underrated good movies out there but when you see these patterns too often you just get bored of them.

376,Godzilla as a remake: how to analyze the differences between the original and the new ones?,"How can we analyze, comparatively, what the original says about its context and world view, versus the new ones? What different utterances or statements can we find in each one?

If the original film used the monster as a metaphor for the nuclear bomb and represented Japan as an innocent nation, a victim of the atrocities committed towards them, how are these issues treated in the American version? What do the producers, directors and screenwriters of the new versions do about the statements of the original? What does the new ones say about the relationship between the United States and Japan?  Personally, I think the American version follows the formula of the  original Japanese films, portraying Godzilla's transition from natural  disaster to humanity's best defender. However, I had the feeling that Gareth Edwards and his team uses Godzilla's story to make kind of a war movie (and pro military at that). The issue is that, in the Japanese original, Godzilla was an Other (product of the American crimes related to atomic bombs) that had a touching but necessary death (that's why Ishirô Honda putts dramatic music in that scene in the original). In this one the role of Godzilla its not clear: he is a monster, but a good one. However, there are other monsters that are bad. What is the difference between them? What is the position of Godzilla (2014) on the concept of monsters? It seems that the answer is: the other should be tolerated as long as their interests do not clash with ours.

Recently, I edited the first part of two videos about this topic. I'll leave the first part down here. I would like to read your opinions on the subject in the comments!

379,"Last night I watched ""Beautiful Boy""","I always avoided films with Timothée Chalomet because they seemed to be fluffy, and maybe I was a little jealous of his jaw and hair. Anyway, I decided to watch this film last night because I have been struggling with addiction myself. I don't actually even watch movies anymore, I spend most of my free TV time watching cartoons. Anyway, I was really taken with Beautiful Boy. It was a very painful meditation on addiction, its wonton disregard for personal health, and its affect on the people close to the addict. I cried almost the whole time. And I think, maybe, remembering those characters will help me stay off dangerous drugs. 

I would definitely recommend this movie because it was a meaningful, acted well, with a beautiful  soundtrack. But TBH I'm not sure anybody wants all that negativity unless they need it. So if you or someone you love needs some perspective on their partying habits, maybe check out Beautiful Boy.

During the fight the guy in bright green at one point jumps through both rings as the bad guy was swinging them and the camera zoomed in close and did the slow motion.

382,Looking for a movie. Watched as a kid.,"So let me begin with why and how I don't remember this movie. Watched it on either Hbo or Cinemax 15 years ago. Growing up in a Catholic household anything remotely strange on tv. Would be quickly turned off. So I only watched half it maybe.

What I remembered:

A boy is relocated due to his mother passing away or either because she's unfit to be a mother. Or maybe even abandoned. 

Ends up living with his aunt or uncle, who already have a family of their own. There's immediate friction between the boy and the family. Very bad. The parents of the family for having to support an additional child with such short notice. Then his cousins who hate him for pretty much existing. So they're is constant bullying, even the parents kinda jump in as well.
At some point he either finds out that his mom is alive or maybe it's another family member of his. He finds out through the phone. He decides to look for them.

He comes up with the plan of leaving. Running away he ends up somehow on the road. Near the dessert. On a long 2 lane that goes both directions. I forget how it happens but he ends up getting a car. There's a scene where he is driving and at some point a police cruiser ends up tailing him. He's scared but doesn't react. The police car approaches next to him, see's him and does nothing. Keeps going. 

(In the last explanation, some things might be in the wrong order but that's how I remember it) 

The boy continues to drive. He then laters ends up meeting an older girl with blonde hair. In her mid 20s or so. Who he finds comfort in. He befriends her and trust her. (I forgot to mention this but he at some point ends up getting a box of raisins. On this box is a picture of a beautiful blonde lady, he cherishes this box of raisins due to the picture) the girl he meets reminds him of the girl on the box. 

He tells her his story and what he's been through. She feels sorry for him and they take a plane flight. 

That's where my memory ends of the movie. They're might be something I missed. Or gotten wrong. For one, the flight might've been before he runs away. He might've been on a vacation flight with his new family. And some how gets lost on purpose. To escape. 



Well thanks in advance. Hope I got everything that I can remember. Sometimes I think to myself wether I actually saw this movie or I dreamt it.

386,THEORIES ON In the Tall Grass™,"Sorry bad english

In In the Tall Grass™ we know nothing about the grass. The grass is mystical yes, mysterious yes, realistic no. 

Now let's talk about the grass. I personally think the grass is actually a portal in time. The evidence I have is the one line one character said "" you tried left but didn't go left instead right but you didn't go right you ran straight instead but all concludes you run into me"" (or something like that). Now what we deduce from this line is the grass can give you different outcomes. It's like as if different timelines try to collide into one thus giving them the illusion of being moved by the grass. On one of the first scenes we see a scene where they said they weren't moving and jumped upwards. They jumped normally on the first time and then the second time the person was further. Maybe there was a timeline where he did not stop moving instead he moved or ran backwards.
The grass is many things but alive is not one of them

I saw Gemini Man and while it was pretty mediocre (I wish I saw it in HFR), it really reminded me how great Will Smith is as an actor when he pushes himself.

Animated.
1980’s/1990’s feel.
A kid is being held in a big house by an abusive old man. Maybe his grandfather?
Old man has a cane.
Some animals are trying to help him out, but having trouble in the house themselves?

1980’s/1990’s feel.

401,[Spoilers] Why did The Aftermath get so many negative reviews?,"Just watched it on a plane, and I was shocked to see it had such poor reviews. Sure, it wasn't the most amazing movie I've ever seen, but I thought the acting was great, the plot was believable, and the setting of post-surrender Germany was interesting (e.g. I had never thought about people like the 88s existing).

I definitely thought the relationship between Knightley and Clarke's characters was strange, with some tension that doesn't make sense - until later in the movie, when they reveal that he didn't come home after their son died, even though he could have. Their relationship didn't break down while she was with him in Germany, it had already broken down. This makes clear the contrast between her husband and the German: while her husband has completely shut down after the death of their son, the German mourned his wife but continued on, still emotionally available to his daughter and caring for her.

At the end, she goes back to her husband because she realizes that he was just as affected by their son's death as she was, and that they could make it work because they were feeling the same pain. He wasn't cold or uncaring, he was just broken, like her.

I found this storyline compelling, and along with the acting, the movie certainly doesn not seem deserving of the scores/reviews it received.

So, what did you guys think? Have I mentioned anything as a positive that you didn't like, or have a failed to see a downside that you saw clearly?

Side note, I thought the way they executed the attempted assassination was well done. After getting into that argument at the dinner/gala/whatever, he was angry and opted to drive the car, which ended up saving his life. It was dark on that wooded road, so the 88 probably couldn't see who was where in the car and probably assumed the husband would be in the passenger seat. If she hasn't said anything to him and they had driven home normally, he would've died.

The comfort issue is one that often gets talked about as the single biggest hurdle in diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea. As such, it’s been part of a huge amount of historical revisionism on both the left and right wing. Admittedly, I myself had fallen victim to some of these talking points that you see on Reddit, particularly on this subreddit. I’d seen people comment “Japan’s apologised several times to Korea over comfort women! This is just efforts by Korea to antagonise Japan” Sadly, I had accepted some of that as true, thinking that Japan had really properly apologised. 

Today, I had the opportunity to meet with Dezaki sensei at a screening of the film and was absolutely blown away by how well put together it was and how much I learnt from it. The connections between Abe’s cabinet and Nippon Kaigi, or Abe’s essential refute of the Kono statement of 93, in which Japan did promise to teach the proper history of its imperial actions in Korea, Abe’s connection to far right wing revisionist groups, etc. 

The film is still screening across Japan and Korea in some independent cinemas and I really recommend you check it out if you can, even if you think you have your mind made, just to have your views questioned.

For god sakes, *Slenderman* was an absolute joke of a film.
But here is the worst thing. Because the Horor genre has been oversaturated with bad shit, good ol classic Horor Films are suffering from it. *The Shining* a film that was scary as hell when I first watched it, is just good now, not scary, just good. At this point, those old films that I was once terrified of, do nothing.

431,Longest Running Film Franchise,"Recently I was thinking back on my childhood of watching the 'Air Bud' films, and decided to give it a look on google. After seeing the Google reviews I clicked on the IMDB Page to see what some actual critics thought of it.

Now, You may know that Star Trek is one of the film franchises with the most amount of films, with (As of Right now) 13 Films made. This has earned it a spot in some ""Franchises with the most Films"" Lists, and yet I haven't Seen the Air Bud/Air Buddies movies on any of those lists, even though it has 12 Films.

432,Was the ending of Chef (2014) circular?,"I recently watched Chef, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(2014_film), for the first time. I overall enjoyed the film, but found the ending odd. Needless to say spoilers from this point forward....

So through dialog in the movie we learn Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) was once seen as an up and coming chef. At some point after receiving positive press for his cooking, the owner of the restaurant where Casper works at the start of the movie hired him.

The owner (Dustin Hoffman) apparently supported him. The kitchen in the restaurant was really nice and the owner mentioned how he purchased highly quality gear at Casper's request. The staff also seems to be quite competent and capable. I can't quite remember the details, but it seems like Casper brought in people he knew previous to working at the restaurant (e.g. the owner gave Casper the authority to build out his own team).

So the initial act of the movie shows that Casper has gotten into a rut. He has been cooking the same thing over and over for years and when he hears a food critic is coming to review his menu, he wants to spice it up. This conflicts with what the owner wants to do, this goes back and forth, and long story short it ends with Casper screaming at the critique and going off to do soul searching.

In his soul searching he purchases a food truck and reconnects with his love of cooking (and his son and ex-wife) as he now has full creative control of what he is cooking.

At the end of the movie the food critic comes to him and tells him his food is great and that he wants to go into business with him on a restaurant. Also he re-marries his wife (Sofía Vergara).

Isn't this somewhat circular? The movie starts at the end of Casper's relationship with the owner of the restaurant, but it seems like their relationship started this same way. The owner of the restaurant brought him in because he's a really good chef and gave him a lot of support to do his job. Also, presumably, he was still married to his wife when he initially started working at the first restaurant.

Overall enjoyed Chef, it has its faults (the biggest is the relationship with his ex-wife doesn't make much sense), but also some charm as well. Just found the end particularly confusing, especially if you have been paying attention to the plot/dialog of the movie.",movies,"Was the ending of Chef (2014) circular?

One of Gilligan’s quotes from the article:

&gt;I didn’t get super far down the road, but it was probably going to be a young woman who needed some help,” he says. “He was hiding out by the Canadian border, and this woman was working at a motel as a housekeeper or something.  [He] goes into the process of saving her, knowing full well that he’s going to suffer for it, he’s going to get caught for it, but he does it anyway. And the last scene would be maybe him in a jail cell but at peace for the first time since the movie began. I think there was going to be this component where he couldn’t sleep. He wouldn’t get a single night sleep for a week or so upon escaping. The police are looking for him and he’s too haunted and he’s too adrenaline-charged. And at the end of the thing, he’s in a jail cell, and ironically he can fall asleep like a baby. And I thought, ‘Ah, that’d be kind of cool.'”

Apparently Golligan’s partner as well as Peter Gould helped change his mind

I actually might like this ending more? Have to think about it.

**EDIT**:

More here. 

https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-vince-gilligan.html

&gt;**After Breaking Bad ended, you said that Jesse Pinkman was free, that he successfully got away. All these years, you maintained that. But I wondered if you had second thoughts as you started to write the movie. Were there other possibilities you considered?**
﻿
&gt;Yes, I did. I like irony in storytelling. I love ironic twists. Once I had set about coming up with this movie, for the longest time I had it in my mind that the thing we wanted most to see was for Jesse to escape. And the thing he wanted most to do was escape. So I was trying to concoct a plot in which, hero that he is, he saves somebody else — somebody I would have introduced as a new character into the movie. Because he’s such an innately heroic character in my mind, he saves someone at the end of the movie and he willfully gets himself caught knowing that it’ll save this other person. At the end of the movie, he’d be locked in a jail cell somewhere in Montana or someplace. And he would be at peace with it. It was all this very interior, emo-type, very dramatic stuff.

&gt;I pitched it to my girlfriend, Holly, and she said, “Are you out of your mind? You can’t have him in a jail cell at the end. You got to let him get away. People will riot.” I said, “No, don’t you get it? It’s art. It’s artistic.” And then I said, “No offense, you’re not a writer. I respect you, of course, and I love you. But you’re not a writer.” And then I went the next day and pitched it to Peter [Gould] and the writers of Better Call Saul, and they all looked at me in silence. They said, “Are you crazy? He’s got to get away at the end.” [Laughs.] As the saying goes, if enough people tell you you’re drunk, you need to sit down. So I dispensed with that idea.

&gt;**Had you worked out who this new character was going to be?**

&gt;I hadn’t quite worked it out. To my credit, I was kicking this idea around, but I didn’t get too far down the road with it. I didn’t actually start writing it, but I had some pretty definitive ideas. I spent a couple of weeks on that. But I’m glad I discarded it. Sometimes you succeed by giving people the opposite of what they want, but sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes you just got to give folks what they want.

Spoilers ahead of movies [Videodrome](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086541/) and [Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2) (links to IMDb also provide a description of the films, so keep that in mind)

&gt;!Videodrome wasn't perhaps in its time of release, considered to be one of the greats of horror. More like ""interesting idea, but why the morbidity"" would be a typical response I guess. Or not even understanding the film all that well. Network came before Videodrome and had some similarities. Network differed from Videodrome genre-wise, and in the ones behind the wheels of mass media, and what they wanted.

As I prepare to rewatch the entire thing for the 10th year in a row, it really boggles my mind that no matter how many times I watch them, the sheer enjoyment and exhilaration of taking this journey never, ever gets old or any less fun than it did when I first watched it.

There are so many things that make these movies as rewatchable as they are - the actors who truly breathed life into their well-developed characters, the incredible production/art design and set pieces, the deep lore and worldbuilding, the gorgeous scenery etc. etc. What I  personally really find that stands out to me, and why they never seem to get old, is that feeling of adventure and continuously escalating stakes. The first movie is fairly low-stakes, starting off in the cozy Shire and following the characters through a series of narrow escapes and chase scenes. But the scope just continues to widen, not just in every movie, but pretty much every set piece, until it leads to an all-out war in the ROTK. It really gets you invested in the fate of the world and the characters, and genuinely care about what happens as things get more epic.

503,Haven't been able to find the name of this movie ANYWHERE,"I've tried Google, What's my movie.com, subreddit  TOMT, IMDB and I got nothing, so maybe one of you can help 😊

I remember seeing a movie during the 90s, it was played on cable TV fairly regularly where I live (Arg)

I remember random scenes, which included:
- A woman on some sort of vacation or spa resort 
- She is investigating the disappearance or death of her sister
- There is a scene, it could be a flashback, involving an archaeological dig, but I could be wrong about this
- Woman ends up finding out that her sister had been murdered and her body fed to the local sharks 
- The man who killed the sister was an acquaintance of theirs and the woman might even had slept with him
- The woman ends up killing her sister's murderer in self defense by throwing him off board and he gets eaten by sharks too

Thank you in advance for any contribution!!",movies,"Haven't been able to find the name of this movie ANYWHERE I've tried Google, What's my movie.com, subreddit  TOMT, IMDB and I got nothing, so maybe one of you can help 😊

504,"I think one of the reasons ""Saving Private Ryan"" was so effective was a lot of it seemed improvised.","Saving Private Ryan got a lot of things right, from it's visceral battle scenes to its excellent performances. But one of the things that I keep coming back to on it is that a lot of the dialogue and actions seemed unrehearsed and spontaneous. I don't mean that in a negative way. It came across as something the characters would actually say. Very few war films are able to do this anymore. For example, when they were landing on the beach, there is a lot of technical dialogue about their location in relation to the other sectors. A lot of war films don't worry about that because they think the audience doesn't care, but it gives the scene an extra sense of realism. Another example is when they're looking through dog tags and the joking they're doing whilst looking. It didn't seem like any of that was rehearsed. IDK just something I always liked about that film.",movies,"I think one of the reasons ""Saving Private Ryan"" was so effective was a lot of it seemed improvised.

For most of my adult life, I've had a very limited memory of this movie I saw at home when I was younger. Was probably playing throughout the majority of it hence why I don't remember much. I've tried Googling but with not much luck -  I'm hoping with the Internet, a movie savant out there might be able to grasp onto the clues and help me figure it out.

Here's what I know/remember:

1. I'm thinking I saw it in the early to mid 90's (but it was at home so release could have been mid to late 80's)
2. It was a space-themed movie for kids with kids (i.e., kids were the crew in space)
3. A random plot point I remember-ish is that a group of kids were stuck in a space capsule that was running out of air so they agreed not to talk but one kid wishes they had french fries (or something...) and some other kid said stop using the air.
4. I *think* it was produced/distributed by New Line Cinema - but this might be a false memory

511,1001 List Review: The Heiress,"The Heiress 1949

Plot Synopsis:

Catherine (Olivia de Havilland), a young woman who stands to inherit her father's large fortune, falls in love when she meets Morris (Montgomery Clift), who gives her the love and affection her father doesn't, and which she desperately needs. Catherine's father (Ralph Richardson), believing Morris is only after the money, tells Catherine she will be disinherited if she marries him. Morris' true intentions are put to the test when he finds out about the amended will.

 [https://imgur.com/a/GCCCVXz](https://imgur.com/a/GCCCVXz) 

My Take:

  
I always have a bit of difficulty getting fully invested into any movie I watch. This one drew me in without my even realizing it. I was embarrassed by the titular Heiress’s naivete, I was suspicious of the intentions of her suitor, I got a sick sense of amusement whenever her father pointed out she had almost no good qualities and many bad ones (which he does often). In short, I felt along with this movie, despite its age. I was going to chalk up the fact I liked it to simply being susceptible to melodrama due to years of watching *The Young and Restless* along with my parents during dinner, but I realized there was another reason; the main character wised up and grew and got her little piece of revenge at the end. It's not just some tragedy.

You will be embarrassed for the heiress at the beginning and cheer for her at the end, a sign of an enthralling narrative. Also note she didn’t have/want/need another man to replace the one who betrayed her at the end. The original story was written by a married couple, which probably played a part in how independent she became over the course of the story.

Context:

Film was released in 1949 and set in the 1850’s. Although, other than the peculiarities of courtship at the time, I’d say the events of the story are pretty timeless. Seeing how people operated in a courtship centered social space instead of a dating one is a bit of a culture shock, but the historical goings on at the time are ultimately unimportant to the story. That [Lucky Old Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3kvxN3xFc) by Frankie Laine was the number one song by sales in 1949. Obviously no data exists for 1850 for such a thing. [Samson and Delilah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_and_Delilah_(1949_film)) was the number one film that year.

512,What do you feel about crime films?,"I love true crime books, crime/gangster documentaries and crime films of all genres. Heist, gangster, film noir, murder mysteries and etc. It's so fascinating what trouble criminals can get themselves into.

Like his life is a stack of poker chips that can get called on by anyone at anytime on a hand they can't even see yet. Whether he's a crime boss, gangster, hitman, robber, drug dealer, thief, adulterer who plans to kill his wife and etc.

My top ten films will probably be all crime films. My top 2 favorites would be Goodfellas 1A and Pulp Fiction 1B.

513,Million Dollar Baby (2004). Clint Eastwood's neo-noir sports drama reminds us how films are best created.,"Currently watching Clint Eastwood's filmography for the first time. Never seen any of his work before. So far I've seen Mystic River, Gran Torino, and Million Dollar Baby.

What an amazing filmmaker he is. His style is like an entirely new genre of cinema that I've never experienced.

Million Dollar Baby is truly one of the best films I have ever seen and I say that without any hesitation. The film is just so excellent at depicting characters with clarity and truth. I sat in silence for the entire length of the film because I was drawn so deeply into the lives of Maggie and Frankie that I was unable to comprehend that I was even watching a movie. The experience was unparalleled.

Everything was just so real. Clint Eastwood pays attention to the films supporting characters, who make the surrounding world feel incredibly genuine.

The dialogue is masterful. Hilary Swank is nothing short of electrifying in every scene she's in. The way she carries Maggie with a particular intensity and deep attentive gaze completely blew me away.

edit: she won an academy award for this performance. not surprised.

The cinematography is sensational. Characters' faces would slide in and out of shadow. The use and disuse of lighting was wonderfully obedient to the tone of each scene.

I could not recommend a film more highly. What a remarkable movie.",movies,"Million Dollar Baby (2004). Clint Eastwood's neo-noir sports drama reminds us how films are best created.

515,*Before Sunrise*,"So I tried watching Before Sunrise two years back and I just ended it after they got off the train and thought that it might be some kind of a boring movie. Well after two years, I watched Before Sunrise today. And this movie is amazing on so many levels. It just made me connect. No thriller, nothing. Just two individuals on a journey of life. Happening to meet one another. Having a connection. Discussing things that at this point of my life I wanted to discuss it with someone. Having the time of their life in just one day. I mean its amazing. The way they layer by layer express themselves to one another, slowly remove the boundaries they had created. Its all so beautiful. And on the other hand this film itself is so calming. Like so much calming I can't even describe. This just dawned upon me that how only one day can make or break you. They just had a day to themselves. And all they could do was just build up their connection. And at the end they had to part.
Slipping a little bit away from the movie, I think that we all kind of incomplete in some way. We need people who can understand us, who can give us healthy criticism, who can indulge in our fantansies with us!! We all need someone in sort of any relationship that might be. It doesn't always need to be a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship. You just need someone who can have a heart to heart with you!!

PS. I was 15 two years back and I totally wouldn't have understood it back then like I did today. Because I'm a changed person now. And my outlook on life has changed. We all evolve as the years go by!! It was surely a good time now to come across this movie!!

524,What are the best comedy movies of all time?,"I love Elf as a Christmas film and think it’s Will Ferrell’s best. I would also suggest people to watch Some Like It Hot for an old comedy, it’s a great movie that stands the test of time, but Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is my personal favorite. Steve Martin and John Candy are both great in the movie, and the message really shines through, to a point where I think the performances and emotional impact elevates the film over other comedies in its genre. I know a lot of people would say Ferris Bueller or The Breakfast Club is Hughes’ best film, but I believe it’s PT&amp;A. To me, it’s a timeless holiday classic that’s aged well compared to most comedies of the era. 

For more raunchy comedies, I’d also highly recommend The Forty Year Old Virgin, Superbad, and There’s Something About Mary. For anyone who liked Superbad, Pineapple Express is also really hilarious. The Cornetto Trilogy is also very good: Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and The World’s End are all solid comedy movies. For anyone who enjoys the Coen Brothers, I’d suggest that you watch The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading if you didn’t already. Groundhog Day is another movie that I‘d say, is a level above most comedies; the premise and story are great, and I believe it’s Bill Murray’s best movie and performance. 

I’m not big into Adam Sandler comedies, but hey, I thought Happy Gilmore was decent. I recently rewatched the first Austin Powers movie, and thought it aged surprisingly well. For romantic comedies, When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral were really good too.

528,Which Are The Best Victim Characters In Horror Films?,"Horror films are notorious for generally having very disposable and unlikable characters with no much personality to them. They are mostly just there to be killed by the serial killer and to try to survive. However, there are at times where there are victims in horror films that are compelling and have far more depth to them than average victim character.

One of my favorite examples are Mima Kirigoe from ""Perfect Blue"", who despite being part of the trope of the ""innocent girl become mature"", she does go beyond that. Mima is a character who, while acts stereotypically like a good girl, does surprisingly have more humanity to her and does have her more conflicting and darker thoughts, which is shown through the fake Mima, which represents her self-doubt, self-judgement, her desire to hold to her past and other feelings that she keeps inside her but at the same time, a side in her that taunts her. While she cares about others and wants to help, she also desires something better for herself and she doesn't feel happy at all with what she doesn't. She doesn't always accept being part of tjis contribution and that makes her hold a grudge for herself even getting involved in something that she feels will make her be seen in an negative way by society and also a grudge for the people she is trying to help for contributing for the change in her career and persona. She is far more complex than many victim characters that you typically see in horror.

And there's Carrie White from 1976's ""Carrie"". Although, I am fairly conflicted by choosing her since she is kinda practically the villian as she is responsible for the horror that occurs later. However, she is definitely portrayed as a victim in the movie. A victim of bullying, abuse from her mother, the shame of her sexuality and gender and trauma, which leads her into causing the prom massacre. Not to mention that her crazy, religious mother tries to kill her at the end. She is one of my favorite female characters in film.",movies,"Which Are The Best Victim Characters In Horror Films?

549,I did not enjoy Ad Astra.,"Don't get me wrong, there were some parts of the movie that I really liked. I loved the opening scene on the space tower. The effects and lighting choices were top-notch throughout. The Mad Max chase on the moon was really fun. The scene in the comms room on Mars was excellent.

However, there were way too many parts of the movie that bugged me for me to fully buy into it.

- The voice-over narration. It felt really clunky and unnecessary almost every time.
- The space monkeys. Not only is that scene really absurd, but it has no bearing on the plot, and feels like it's only in the movie to add one more action scene.
- The scene where...
    1. The protagonist sneaks onboard a rocket by climbing up the side during the launch countdown.
    2. When he gets onboard, every member of the crew immediately whips out a space-gun.
    3. Within 30 seconds, all three of them accidentally kill themselves.
- During the space walk back to his shuttle, why did he rocket himself towards it so fast that he painfully bounced off of it several times? I couldn't help but laugh when that happened.
- Why did he use the nuke to propel himself home? It was never established that there was any kind of fuel shortage for the mission, and that seems insanely risky.",movies,"I did not enjoy Ad Astra.

564,Adele's Skyfall is Bond (Daniel Craig) talking to M (Judi Dench) about their difficult relationship.,"Like the rest of Skyfall, the theme is very introspective of Bond as a person, his relationships, and the franchise in general. I always thought that M was the true *bond girl* in this film, and that the theme is an ode to her and Bond's relationship.   I've picked out a few lines I thought represented this, as well as listed a link to the song and the lyrics below. 

* *Let the sky fall / When it crumbles / We will stand tall / Face it all together / At skyfall*: After the bombing of MI6, the sky is falling per se for Bond and M. They will work together to stop the villain, ultimately bringing them to Bond's childhood home of Skyfall.
* *You may have my number, you can take my name / But you'll never have my heart:* Bond is loyal to M, but will always have a fraught personal relationship with her. 
* *Where you go I go / What you see I see / I know I'd never be me / Without the security / Of your loving arms / Keeping me from harm:* Bond is under M's care, for better or worse. Points out the irony of Bond getting hit by the risky gunshot at the beginning of the film that M authorized.
* *Put your hand in my hand / And we'll stand:* A reference to the showdown at Skyfall at the end of the film. Regardless of what happens and his feelings, Bond still pledges to stand by M's side.

**Skyfall**

This is the end  
Hold your breath and count to ten  
Feel the earth move and then  
Hear my heart burst again  


For this is the end  
I've drowned and dreamt this moment  
So overdue I owe them  
Swept away, I'm stolen  


Let the sky fall  
When it crumbles  
We will stand tall  
Face it all together  


Let the sky fall  
When it crumbles  
We will stand tall  
Face it all together  
At skyfall  
That skyfall  


Skyfall is where we start  
A thousand miles and poles apart  
Where worlds collide and days are dark  
You may have my number, you can take my name  
But you'll never have my heart  


Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)  
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)  
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)  
Face it all together  


Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)  
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)  
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)  
Face it all together  
At skyfall  


*\[x2:\]*  
(Let the sky fall  
When it crumbles  
We will stand tall)  


Where you go I go  
What you see I see  
I know I'd never be me  
Without the security  
Of your loving arms  
Keeping me from harm  
Put your hand in my hand  
And we'll stand

I always thought that M was the true *bond girl* in this film, and that the theme is an ode to her and Bond's relationship.   I've picked out a few lines I thought represented this, as well as listed a link to the song and the lyrics below. 

* *Let the sky fall / When it crumbles / We will stand tall / Face it all together / At skyfall*: After the bombing of MI6, the sky is falling per se for Bond and M. They will work together to stop the villain, ultimately bringing them to Bond's childhood home of Skyfall.
* *You may have my number, you can take my name / But you'll never have my heart:* Bond is loyal to M, but will always have a fraught personal relationship with her. 
* *Where you go I go / What you see I see / I know I'd never be me / Without the security / Of your loving arms / Keeping me from harm:* Bond is under M's care, for better or worse. Points out the irony of Bond getting hit by the risky gunshot at the beginning of the film that M authorized.
* *Put your hand in my hand / And we'll stand:* A reference to the showdown at Skyfall at the end of the film. Regardless of what happens and his feelings, Bond still pledges to stand by M's side.

**Skyfall**

This is the end  
Hold your breath and count to ten  
Feel the earth move and then  
Hear my heart burst again  


For this is the end  
I've drowned and dreamt this moment  
So overdue I owe them  
Swept away, I'm stolen  


Let the sky fall  
When it crumbles  
We will stand tall  
Face it all together  


Let the sky fall  
When it crumbles  
We will stand tall  
Face it all together  
At skyfall  
That skyfall  


Skyfall is where we start  
A thousand miles and poles apart  
Where worlds collide and days are dark  
You may have my number, you can take my name  
But you'll never have my heart  


Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)  
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)  
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)  
Face it all together  


Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)  
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)  
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)  
Face it all together  
At skyfall  


*\[x2:\]*  
(Let the sky fall  
When it crumbles  
We will stand tall)  


Where you go I go  
What you see I see  
I know I'd never be me  
Without the security  
Of your loving arms  
Keeping me from harm  
Put your hand in my hand  
And we'll stand  


Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)  
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)  
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)  
Face it all together  


Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)  
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)  
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)  
Face it all together  
At skyfall  


Let the sky fall  
We will stand tall

565,"Her (2013) - A film I wanted to watch, and I still do after watching it","First and foremost - what an incredible film. 


After hearing the relationship between Lost in Translation and this movie, I wanted to watch this. Apparently it's two sides of the same story, and since Lost in Translation is my current favourite movie, I felt like I had to. 


But just saying it's a movie made solely for Jonze to redeem himself after Sofia Coppola's ""accusation"" of him being a boring dorky man in Lost in Translation, that would do the movie no justice. 


The movie revolves around Theodore Twombly looking for a restart of his life after a break-up that got him all teared up. He finds comfort in an Operating System (OS), a revolutionary AI to accompany people in their daily lives. His OS calls herself Samantha, and it doesn't take long until their relationship surpasses a simply professional one.


First of all I was charmed by the use of colour in this movie; above all, the colour red. It's omnipresent throughout the scenes and it will stay with me as an immediate association I have with that colour for sure.      
The cinematography, and I know it's cliché to talk about it, is gorgeous. I've never felt like wanting a different camera perspective in any scene.      
I haven't seen any other movie starring Joaquin Phoenix, so for me this actor is still fresh. I could not compare it to another movie. But what an actor he is - not only did I feel for Theodore, I want to go as far as saying I wish I was a friend of his. 
Then there is Scarlett, who is almost as powerful as she was in Lost in Translation but without actually appearing on screen. She is the only thing in the movie that reminds me Lost in Translation and Her are related in a way. That does not take away any enjoyment, though.        
The story is so neatly pieced together, completely based on one concept: when are computers more than just computers? After all, we humans also think in 1's and 0's, and so do they. Computers are the children of humanity, and children should grow up to surpass their parents, shouldn't they? But at the same time, can we stand the thought of us human beings having deep emotional connection to something that's - in a sense - not-human at all, and should it be viewed as a kind of bestiality? The subject this film touches on set me to think a lot. I recently read the collection of stories by Asimov, I, Robot, that are all about the human-computer relationship. The feelings I got from the book and this movie were very similar and that's a compliment for Spike Jonze, that he took matters and worked them out as deeply as the late Asimov did, an icon in science-fiction.         
But eventually it all comes down to being a beautiful love story, and I don't mean that as a bad thing. You root for Samantha and Theo just as much as you root for any other couple in a romance movie. Maybe even more because both get so much more dimension than your average rom-com roles. Samantha and Theo do have something special together, how unlikely that seems if you look at the nature of their relationship on it's surface.         
Yes, the movie can be slow at times, with parts that are just music-driven slideshows of Theodore walking around without any plot-progression, but if you are a fan of character-driven movies you will not find that an issue as every shot of Theodore makes him slightly more likable, every sound of Samantha's voice makes her a bit more real, and every shot of their surroundings increases your understanding in what kind of a world they live in - a world not that different from ours. 


The film is a must-watch for any fan of romance. It did leave me with a few questions that I might be able to answer after a second viewing - I won't discuss them here, though, because they would spoil a lot of the movie.


I'm pretty sure r/movies hates people admiring the same movies over and over and I know how much love there is for this movie on here - but I just wanted to put my thoughts onto paper and I thought I'd review it, because I'm full of it. I did not cry, unfortunately, and I felt like at times I could've if I tried to, but I guess it wasn't terrible enough of a day for rain.


I'm not sure yet if I prefer to watch this over Lost in Translation. The latter is a lot easier to watch and doesn't get as vulgar as Her, but at the same time doesn't dip as deep in the pool or take me on such an amazing trip. I like both movies a lot and would recommend both of them to anyone.

Has anybody else seen Entertainment?  I need to talk.

I think I hated this movie.

Endless stunning shots of landscapes and interesting dirty interiors and pretty much no story of any kind.  Every single opportunity to build turning points in a scene, much less to build a sequence of related scenes to a multi-scene crescendo, is squandered as they move onto the next event.  Michael Cera shows up, there's a great suspenseful build-up to something, then  nothing happens.

Turkington's cousin is a well-meaning dickhead, we build and build on that, and then nothing comes of it.

He leaves a thousand voicemails for his daughter, and that's never paid off in any way.

His flagrantly unfunny opening act takes off his shoes, acting compellingly like a son toward Turkington, then that relationship is never mentioned or furthered.

A woman attacks him outside a bar with no effect on any other part of the film.

In good film, scenes exist for a reason.  Characters enter a scene with one emotional tone and leave with another.  One scene motivates characters further into a sequence (a set of related scenes) that pays off several scenes down the line.  Characters come into a situation with a certain intent but turning points send them in a direction they never expected.  In Entertainment, our protagonist refuses to take action at every turn and the most emotional scene in the movie, his last performance, has no effect on any other scene.  What the hell, Alverson?

585,Disney should absolutely start premiering films on Disney+ at the same time they open in theaters,"Even if its only a one-time view or 24hr rental, Disney should drop new films on its streaming service opening weekend. 

For one, the industry is clearly heading that way anyway so it’s better to start the trend and force the competition to catch up. 

For another, it would help cement Endgame as the biggest box office of all time since once the online premier push happens the US box office will be forever changed. Sure, the foreign (ie Chinese) box office will still be huge (though even that just might change the way people are starting to look at the relationship between American business and Chinese politics), but domestically people are more likely to watch movies on their phone or whatever than even a tv screen. 

Last, it just might make the 3d home theater thing take off, especially as the Avatar sequels start rolling out.

590,1001 List Review: West Side Story,"West Side Story 1961

So I’m taking a mini retirement and decided to add yet another movie review post no one asked for to the list. During my weeks/months of time away from work, I'm aiming to watch one movie a day from the list of [1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/1001+movies+you+must+see+before+you+die/). I’m mostly doing the write-ups to keep myself mentally engaged and from doing literally nothing all day, which is my true heart’s desire. I’m an accountant by trade (no really) so my opinions are beyond unqualified. Feel free to disagree, you’ll probably educate me.

Plot Synopsis:

A musical in which a modern day Romeo and Juliet are involved in New York street gangs. On the harsh streets of the upper west side, two gangs battle for control of the turf. The situation becomes complicated when a gang members falls in love with a rival's sister.

[https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-film-classic-3o7aTm3qSAdSfwzVkY](https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-film-classic-3o7aTm3qSAdSfwzVkY)

My Take:

The story follows Tony and Maria, star-crossed lovers who meet at a 50’s dance but cannot be together because of Maria’s brother’s grudge against Tony’s former gang, the Jets. Maria’s brother, Bernardo, is the leader of the rival gang the Sharks. The actual plot plays out just as tawdry and melodramatic as real Romeo and Juliet feels nowadays. From my skimming Wikipedia the music pushed a lot of boundaries at the time and for the most part it’s pretty excellent and kept me engaged with the movie, despite how cheesy everything is. Most of the characters are much better dancers than actors; I assume that is due to the fact it was seen as a musical first and not because, say, acting wasn’t invented yet or something. An exception is Rita Moreno, who is pretty darn good at both. She won an academy award so someone 60 years ago agreed with me on that. That being said everyone that sings that aren’t the main two range from “okay” to “kill me”.

Altogether it was a really fun experience of theater translated to film, except for the schlocky parts. But even then it was definitely worth watching and experiencing. No regrets.

Context:

Billboard Hot 100 number-one single at the time was [Hit the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8Tiz6INF7I) Jack by Ray Charles, which goes to show popular musical taste at the time. It makes sense why the music in the play could have been thought of as too challenging.The play premiered during times of rising gang violence, which probably helped it stay relevant. [Brown vs Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) took place three years prior which probably helped inform the themes of “Us vs Them” racial tension, even though the Sharks are Puerto Rican, not Black. Number one film that year was this one.

595,High Life (2018) vs. Prospect (2018),"These two films have narrative and structural similarities in that they are both set in remote space, and have central protagonists who are a father/daughter duet, but couldn’t be more different in execution and  film-making philosophy. 

Both are low-budget indie love-childs of their respective directors (Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell for Prospect and Claire Denis for High-Life). But High-Life is French High-Brow Neo-MindF*ckery while Prospect is more Retro Sci-Fi Western world-building. 

While I enjoyed the performances of the lead actors in both (Robert Pattinson in High Life and Pedro Pascal in Prospect) I couldn’t help but be almost offended by the contempt for audience that High-Life displays with its disorienting and meandering “plot.” Prospect, on the other hand, takes the audience through the directors’ vision with carefully dispersed revelation that is digestible and enjoyable.

599,"Desperately need help finding a movie that appears to have never existed. If anyone has seen it, it’s one of you. Please help!","Last fall my BF and I watched a horror flick that we *cannot find* anywhere, on any platform, no matter what keywords we use. We’ve both spent literally hours dredging the internet and as we don’t know the title, we cannot find the movie anywhere. I’ll describe it below as best I can remember in hopes that someone will recognize it and know the name! 

First and foremost- it is entirely first person POV. Not found footage! It as if the camera is just stuck in the main character’s head and it never moves. 

The main character is a young woman on summer break from college in her sleepy home town. She meets up with two friends, a guy and a girl, and they smoke pot in the woods. It is the Fourth of July, or at least there is a fireworks celebration that night. Lots of POV shots of her cellphone in her hand. 

They go to the celebration and during the fireworks it is announced that a young girl is missing, and there’s some kind of curfew, so they make home. They stop at a party and drink, eventually she ends up home. The killer is inside her house and the first of many many scuffles ensues. I think at this point she’s texting her brother to stay away. She runs to a neighbors house and then out into the town. 

In the final 20 minutes or so, in running from the killer, she is hit by a car. The killer starts chasing her again and she runs into a gas station, and he follows. Shots were fired? Possibly? Either way the movie ends with her stabbing the shit out of the killer as the police blast into the gas station yelling to have her hands up. Again, all 100% POV and not in the found footage sort of way. 

If you know what movie I’m talking about you will save both my BF and I from assuming we had a dual hallucination for 90 minutes roughly a year ago and now we’re going crazy.

605,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil," CGI action is a plague on this movie, as it descends slowly down the spiral to an MCU style 'big finish' battle. Much money was spent on it no doubt, but watching it you find yourself asking 'why?'.

Why has hollywood not realised we are collectively bored of this yet? Seriously,  when action sequences go on for minutes, and zero sense of threat or weight is present because cgi still doesn't look or move correctly, it's  time to realise not every blockbuster needs to ape Marvel/Disney. One punch that looks like it really lands and HAS EFFECT is worth inifinitely more than twenty or hundred punches that seemingly do nothing at all, except make noise and particle effects.

Having rewatched the LOTR films again recently, these films are in  many ways what set the ball rolling on the CGI tedium - consider (if you  remember) how good the action is, and how 'meaty' it feels in the FIRST  film. By the time we get to the third 'technology and budget' had  improved, yet the action is considerably more boring... - less real  world choreography, more sprites and pixels.",movies,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil  CGI action is a plague on this movie, as it descends slowly down the spiral to an MCU style 'big finish' battle.

After Scary Movie 2, parody films became about how many pop culture references one can cram into a single movie. The movies became less about telling a cohesive story and more about ""Hey look! Remember this!? That is why it is funny! Because you remember this!"".

These jokes usually broke the film's pacing, style, and genre. Like in one of these films spoofing a part of Narnia, it suddenly became a hiphop song mimicking MTV's cribs. 

These got worse and worse as the films went on. It was all about mocking pop culture trends or long dead viral videos than it was about the primary film they were making fun on.

Taking the master of parody Mel Brooks; all his movies served as an actual storyline.  They all had a plotline with 3 proper acts with actual conflict and resolution.

The humor came from the characters' behavior and dialogue. Such as when Dracula tells the Usher to give a message to Dr Steward. But judt before she does so, he tells her that she will forget everything.

Comedy follows esp her delivery of 'No Tip!?'. The physical humor is not just 'fat guy falls down' but all with great timing and purpose. 

Men in tights has Robin playing the straight man in a world of goofs (never dumb or derpy. Just almost cartoony with their logic).

And of course you have AIRPLANE! Who matches all of these elements then combines it with fantastic background humor, witty and wonderful wordplay, and straight deliveries to absurb situations.

Even Cabin in the Woods plays it straight while providing humor on the mocking of horror tropes. My favorite being ""we should stick together...""

Guy gets sprayed with a chemical

""No...let's split up instead...""

We have great writers today and I am dying for another proper parody that does not rely on the internet, memes, and pop culture.

636,Can Anyone Tell Me the Name of Obscure Netflix Horror Movie...,"Google has turned up nothing and I've been searching for a while now. I saw it within the last few months but it isn't showing up in my watched titles and it's driving me crazy. 

So it's a movie that is a collection of short horror films, each one introduced by a short blurb with the background or origin of the tale. It's like the backstory for different cultures' legends or myths. The first one is super beautiful and is about two young German women, one brunette and one blonde, who see each other in the woods on the way to the creek to wash clothes with other women from the village. The young blonde is apparently pregnant, and the woman of the village seem to be gossiping about it because she appears unmarried (there is very little dialogue in this one, adding to the quiet unsettling vibe). The brunette ends up sneaking off into the woods to spend time with the blonde and gives her her blood-stained clothes to wash in the river so the women don't suspect the blonde of being pregnant anymore. They end up kissing and being spotted by the brunette's superstitious mother, who then makes her pray to some sort of effigy in the woods to not be gay/ possessed.  The brunette ends up having hallucinations/ nightmares about her mother being possessed, instead, and dreams of killing her (if I remember that part correctly?). She seems like she's losing her mind a little bit, not sleeping/ seeing things etc. Her and the blonde continue to meet up and frolic in the sylvan setting and the brunette basically accepts that she's gay/possessed and fast forward to her walking naked into the woods, fully embracing the demonic nature of things. Maybe she killed her mom, I don't quite remember.

Another short was a bunch of drunken Mediterranean men frolicking in, like, Krampus/ demon costumes for some holiday where the veil is thin. A demon comes to check them out in a hooded costume and the men end up finding him out and capturing him, making fun of the demon and abusing him a little bit. I think they make him show them the entrance to hell he crawled out of, and they just get drunker and rowdier the whole way there. There may be a boat they use to cross a body of water, using torches to light their way. I think one of the men ends up going through the gate to the underworld and it possibly shows him wandering by himself into a reddened sort of vague tunnel.

Aaaaaaaaaaand there is also a short (I think it was black and white?) where a man is walking through what looks like a forest, but he's walking around about 6 feet under the ground in a series of passageways. There he encounters a legit crazy woman who tells him he needs to eat 3 fresh-ish hearts and she'll grant him a wish or powers or something. The dude is all for it so when he sees someone get buried he waits and then digs up the corpse and busts out the heart (no easy feat, those ribs are tough) and mows down. Obviously this one is pretty graphic. He then finds like a small kid, and robs that grave, and a woman. I feel like the kid/ baby was the most difficult to watch. The woman in white appears (not quite a ghost because I think you can see her feet and she flails around in some strange trance/ dance) and actually I think she's his last victim. I feel like he killed her and then ate her heart and gained the powers she promised him. I forget how this one ended-- I know the authorities were investigating the plundered graves and hunting him down.

-Bloodshot: It’s going to be a failed franchise starter just like the mummy.

-New Mutants: Does anyone care? Dark Phoenix already flopped. Only way I see it doing well is if the rumour about it being added to the MCU is true (which it probably isn’t)

647,The Best Massive Battle - The Battle of the Helm's Deep?," I had a discussion with a friend of mine about massive battles seen in recent cinema. We were trying to name the best ones that make sense in their own universe and that are executet well. After going through a lot of battles from different genres (Sci Fi, History, Fanatasy) we both decided that the Hem's Deep was our favorite. The runner up was Kingdom of Heaven because it at least tried to show a historical siege and events during that battle made sense (it's not 100% accurate but I found it good enough).

The reason for choosing Helm's Deep is that the battle is just well rounded up without being 30 minutes of mindless slaughter. The pace is great, the timing of events is just superb to keep you on the edge and give you goosebumps. The last charge of Aragorn and Theoden is just full of emotions and makes sense considering their situtation. It might be that I'm biased because I grew up reading LotR but those are just my two cents.

657,"Which Are Your Top 3 Favorite Horror Films Of All Time? And If You Want, You Can Explain Why Do You Enjoy Them.","We are close to Halloween so let's mention our favorite horror movies. My favorite horror movies are:

1. 
Perfect Blue (1997). It haves some of the best transitions I've seen in film which not only gives the film more style but also deliver information, show passage of time and also confuse you like the female protagonist and express her losing sense of time and reality, amazing attention to detail, talks about a lot of subjects that are still very relevant today and do connect to each other in some ways, some great clues, a great twist and some fairly interesting characters that also serve for the themes of the film. I also love how it plays with the idea of fantasy-reality and also describing what Mima is going through her life through the film as it shows a amazing way of breaking the 4th wall, comments on many things at the same time and tell the events occuring in the film, the protagonist's development, etc. The animation, while not perfect, is quite beautiful and makes the psychological horror feel more grounded and that more terrifying. It's also one of those you can watch everytime and learn something new from it. It is my 4th favorite film of all time and my favorite anime/animated film. Though, while I would say it's a pretty disturbing film, I find it more fascinating than disturbing. It's a great must-watch-multiple-times film. It does have some pretty surrealistic-like moments but it isn't supernatural at all but rather, it is psychological and it is very grounded in its horror. It also talks about many subjects and themes that are still very complex like the male gaze, identity, sexuality, fanaticism, mental illness, pressure, the movie/pop industry, the desire of living in the past, etc. They are all connected in some way and are explored in great depth. It's one of the most layered films I've ever seen.

2. 
American Psycho (2000). It's one of the most hilarious movies of all time, in my opinion. It is also very well-written, talks about a lot of nice subjects like the idea of consumerism, identity, conformity, self-worth, greed, the problems of capitalism, the shallowness of the 80's culture, and other social issues. It's also a disturbing movie despite its comedic tone. Christian Bale does one of the best performances for a villian and the villian Bale is playing is already a pretty fascinating character. Patrick Bateman is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time. His performance is not just super entertaining and expressive but it really serves on communicating of what the character is about and surprisingly, despite being over-the-top, there are actually some great subtleties to his performance. Not to mention that a lot of the movie is pretty quotable and memorable. I also just love the big irony of some of its scenes (like in the hookers scene where he talks about how much he loves a song for addressing the problems of abusive political authority when he is basically just doing that with them) and how over-the-top it is over such small things like the business card scene, which not only serves to be very funny but it helps on communicating just how shallow and ridiculous these men are and to show how Bateman really tries too hard on proving himself on having a better business card despite the business cards not looking all that different and also that the idea of business cards looking not much different also serves into communicating another theme/message of the film where other people confuse others for other people due to their self-indulgence.

I also really like the cinematography as it does really express that 80's feel to it and it does look ""nice, very nice"". The business card being especially well-directed and the first monologue scene having the perfect presentation as by giving it this feel of a beauty commercial, it exemplifies the themes of materialism and superficiality in the movie.

It's a pretty fun and smart movie. My favorite satire of all time. Sure, it is unrealistic and absurd but that's the point of the film and it is not exactly trying to be realistic. It is exagerrated but still making a good point with its judgement of capitalism and also making it fitting with its comedic, absurdist tone.

681,"People are dismissing the Ariel casting because it's myth/folktale/legend so they should be able to cast whomever they choose. But if they were to take a creature from say an African culture and the casting were reversed, there would be backlash from those same people.","First off, I admit I was initially unhappy with the differing race casting of Ariel when I assumed they would be recreating the animated story that takes place off the coast of Denmark. Once they announced the story's setting is being changed to the Caribbean, the casting choice doesn't feel so out of place, and they are clearly deviating from the animated film so they should be able to cast whoever.

However, with searching through the unpopular opinions dealing with movie casting in regards to race/ethnicity, one of the biggest arguments I see a lot in regards to the Ariel black casting is that Ariel is a mermaid, a mythical creature built in folk-tale that is arguably entirely fiction. And even though the fairy-tale Disney based their animated movie off of is Danish, it doesn't matter what race she is because she's not a real, human character right? However, I feel that if Hollywood were to take a myth/legend/folk-tale from native African culture and change the characters to be white (or any other race), the same people that were arguing Ariel can be any race would throw their hands up in anger for suddenly ""white-washing"" a character, even if it fits that same criteria of Ariel for being a fictional, mythical creature.

I'll give an example. In the legends of the Ewe people of Ghana and Togo, there is a mythical creature known as the Adze. The Adze is a sort of ""vampire"" if you will that takes the form of a firefly. Upon capturing an Adze it will revert to a human-like form and attack. If Hollywood were to make a movie in Africa, depicting the Adze, people would most likely argue that the Adze should be played by a black person. But if we use the same argument that was used for Ariel, they should be able to cast whoever they want for the role based on acting prowess. As a person of Asian descent myself, if they were to say cast an Asian person for the Adze, I wouldn't feel empowered or more represented in the film industry. I would feel confused as to why they were changing a folk-lore just to pander to my people.

To roundabout what I initially said about my opinion on the Ariel casting. If they were to make a movie about the Adze and set it in Africa, I would prefer they stick to setting and cast a person of African descent. However I would be fine if they were to relocate the story to say, Norway and depict/cast the Adze as a white person.",movies,"People are dismissing the Ariel casting because it's myth/folktale/legend so they should be able to cast whomever they choose.

686,A Walk in the Woods (2015),"I have been a fan of Bill Bryson for a many years even since I read ""Notes from a Big Country"", I then read his book about England, Australia, The Woods and eventually the Universe but the one that stuck for me more than any was ""A Walk in The Woods"", something about the idea of walking the AT in the US sounds real exciting and romantic though I appreciate it is very much very far from that for people who do it and the romantic idea goes downhill (no pun intended) quickly.

So when I heard they were making a book based his novel A Walk in The Woods I really wanted to see it. I cannot claim to know much about Robert Redford (playing Bryson) or or that matter Nick Nolte (playing Katz) but I still wondered if they could pull it off. Redford was not how I imagined Bryson but to his credit he was good and given that almost no-one outside of Iowa knows Katz I had no clue what to expect but both I really enjoyed. There were bits in the film that were not in the book but I guess they had artistic licence and there was a a lot in the book missed in the film but given the length of the book and the time period it was written over this was to be expected.

705,Blade Runner 2049s story is too big and kinda messy,"The biggest mistake of 2049 imho was to make Deckard and its people more important than he actually ever was:

In the first movie he is just some random Film Noir detective that met the love of his live, got caught up in the bigger events, survived a showdown with a foe, discovered some truth about himself in the process and maybe got to live happily ever after. 

The story of him and Rachel on the run could have been a sequel but wasnt necessary.

Instead 2049 made them both into Robot Joseph and Mary giving magical birth to Replicant Female Jesus .

Also blowing up the whole Replicant theme way up than it ever needed to be. And it completely changed the overall tone of the universe.

Blad Runner's magic lies in its compactness, its a Film Noir Crime Story and the Universe hovers above it all, too big and awesome to ever be changed or effected by its events.

The whole Resistance anf big time war looming thing just didnt seem right. It kinda reminded me of Matrix Revolutions. Lifting the curtain too much and taking away the magic and mystery of the universe.

The story just gives Deckard way too much importance in the overall world than he ever had. Nobody in the first movie was ever that special really. It was just lonely characters that found some spark of love and met their fate in a dark and gritty LA  .

It was just a tight Film Noir story that also raised some deep philosophical questions.

The biggest strength of 2049 was probably its love story between K and Joi and I think they could have made a whole movie about just that.

716,About Time: A glorious disaster for a new father,"Hello reddit,

I know at this point I’m probably screaming into the void. I finally got around to watching this movie. I’d seen roughly what it was about and was interested, but never got around to it. I finally found the time (ironic) to watch it and it borderline broke me. 

If you’ve had a reasonably strong relationship with your father this movie will easily tug at your heart strings. If you are a new father (maybe even a little too angry at the world and what it’s become or what you’ve failed to become) it is particularly poignant. 

I don’t really have much of a point to any of this as I type through blurry and teary eyes, but if you haven’t seen it, I’d give it a go. It doesn’t break ground, but its simplicity is beautiful. And it makes you re-evaluate what you have and what’s worth fighting for. Anyways, I enjoyed it, and I hope you do too. If not that’s also cool. Take care.",movies,"About Time: A glorious disaster for a new father Hello reddit,

He really talks about shit, and not just Back to The Future, that sort of unintentionally opens him up more than I've seen in other interviews.

If you're a fan of Crispin Glover, or hell, if you're not and think he's a psychotic weirdo, even better, give it a listen.

740,About Midsommar...,"So to start things, I'm always itching for a good horror film. Sadly those are so few and far between.

Midsommar was something else. Great visuals. Great atmosphere. Amazing acting. Holy hell at that opening.

But with all that said, my god the character writing was bad. It felt like straight up 70s/80s/90s cheeseball horror. Idiot kids making idiot calls. Witness a suicide and then a straight up murder? Nah it's fine. It's just these people's way of life. Totally cool. Let's stick around. Friends start vanishing after knowing these people are capable of murder? Oh it doesn't really matter. Hell one of the main characters literally says, ""We don't associate as friends of his,"" when his buddy vanishes. Like dude no one is going to give a shit about a thesis when literally two of their friends have gone missing along with another couple. There is no fucking way anyone in their right mind would feel comfortable being an outsider among 20+ pagan people that are fine witnessing and inflicting human loss.

The movie builds such a tense atmosphere but every time a character decision is made I feel the urge to face palm. This is not how real people react to traumatic events. I would argue the only characters that seemed to act competently were the British couple that were murdered. Even then a rational mind would have never bought the whole ""your boyfriend already left without you"" claim and gone off with the cult. This is a red flag. The characters even hear the girl scream and make nothing of it. What was the point?

Then there's the cult. They're shown to be murderers, manipulators, and liars. So my question is why do they keep the farce going for so long? When the final arc begins the only two remaining people are Christian and Dani. The final day begins with the cultists lying about their sacred book to cover up the deaths of Josh and Mark. But why? Literally moments later they start the rituals and murder Christian. What the hell was the point of this? Why not drug the fuckers during breakfast? Why bother if they had the paralyzing agent to begin with?

Again, great atmosphere and acting, but jeez was it disappointing to get the same old incompetent protagonists. Also what the fuck was the point of the guy wearing Mark's skin? Like that was at night and didn't seem to have anything to do with the rituals. Pure shock value? It reminds of a scene from another overall great horror film-- It Follows. In that movie, the creature is said to constantly move towards its target. However there is one weird scene where it just stands on a roof as a naked man. This scene made no sense in the context of the story and felt like a shock value insertion.

And thinking back on it, I've always felt cold when it comes to The Rock. Any movie that I have seen him in, or any of his appearances in real life come across as rather calculated and without heart. Like he is being surface level likeable without being likeable.

I know that celebrities obviously don't enjoy the whole chat show circuit social media thing, and that they use it to promote their movies or whatever. I understand that. But with the rock it comes across too obviously like he's doing it just for promotion. It just seems too forced.

768,The Addams Family *SNAP* *SNAP* Review (2019),"SPOILERS!

I'm not the biggest fan of this series, I've barley watched the original, so keep that in mind when reading. I did however watch a high-school theater production of it, and I can say it was better than this movie. The Addams Family (2019) is about the Addams family and their day-to-day life, until Wednesday wants to be different from the family, and Pugsley starts to study to become a real ""Addams"" man. 

The story itself is weird. It revolves a lot over real estate, something I wouldn't want in a kid's horror film. It also shows some signs of ""oh everyone's too attached to their phones these days"" through the plot. At one point people attack the Addams with actual torches. 13 years later in the story, their being attacked with torches ... from their phones. They also try to spread gossip through social media, but it doesn't effect the Addams so I didn't see the point in it.

The animation is mediocre overall, nothing stands out. But the characters, OH GEEZ do they suck. Everyone looks horrible, the normal humans more than the ACTUAL monsters. It's mostly because of their noses. Instead of making every character have their own personality and character traits, they made every character have a distinct nose, aaaand it stinks. It really makes their whole face look hideous. Their waists are also weird. Most women have SUPER tight waists, and all the men are fat.

Character traits are also bad. The most outgoing trait was when one character turns emo, and for a moment I thought we went back to 2009. A Little off topic, this same character then exposes the antagonist through the ""ooooo I got u on camera"" cliche. Problem is, she said it was shown to 3 MILLION people, and never before did we see this type of  social media status through the movie.

The writing is dull. The only good written character was Wednesday. The jokes also fall flat, besides for one. At the end Gomez's brother oddly marries the antagonist (it's really weird. First he rides off into the background with her talking about real estate, and the next scene has them married). The joke in question is when he said ""I can't believe me, an absolute 0 got to be with you, also a 0."" That did get me to chuckle.

The beginning was nice and also was the climax and falling action. My favorite part was when they remade the original theme. Which brings me into the next part, the music. It's BAD. Nothing was memorable besides the main theme, and that was only memorable because they didn't change it. They did do a remix at the end, but it's nothing to ride home about.

A good thing about the movie was the moral, it's to stand out from others and be different (I guess they didn't list to their own movie). It's what every other PG animated movie does these days, but I thought it was OK. But that's why my final rating for this movie is a lazy TV sitcom out of 10.

The animation is bad, the music is bad, the story is bad, and the writing is mediocre, but the moral is fine. It also uses nostalgia to get money. If you really wanted to see this, I would wait until it goes on Netfilx/Hulu/YoutubeTV. It's not worth your money. If you could, I would recommend seeing a high-school theater play, or watching the Original.

776,"People who have seen a lot of movies, do you remember most of them?","I know this is like a weird question, but it's puzzling me.

I'm 23, and I spent most of my time in college with an awesome guy as a roommate and he made me watch all imdb's top 250 and installed a passion of movies for me. So in 4 years I watched 750 movies, now the list is nearing 900.

But to be honest I can't exactly remember... most of these. Some stick to mind, because they spoke to me a lot or I found them pretty interesting. Fight Club being on of those. LOTR, 12 Angry Men, Shawshank, Apocalypse Now.  But for most of them I remember very specific parts or the general feeling they left in me. I remember the ending of ""M"". I remember enjoying the hell out of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But I wouldn't be able to tell you how it ended. I remember some parts of the movie, sure, but I wouldn't be able to tell it as a story. And that's what happens with most movies. Without looking it up. 12 Monkeys. I&gt;!t's about some sort of gang that Brad Pitt has and he is a rich kid and it will destroy the future so they have to go back and they don't believe they are from the future and the main guy sacrifices himself and we last see him as a kid in the airport!&lt;. And that's all I know, it makes no sense at all, I only remember passages of the movie, and I have no idea how A connects to B.

Movies that I didn't find particularly interesting and I only watched for the sake of obligation are all but gone. Casablanca is about some guy who wants to get people out of Africa and then there's a piano and he gets separated from the girl for some reason. Gone with the Wind is about a girl who is spoiled and a guy who goes to war and eventually gets sick of her drama and she grows up. There Will Be Blood has a scene where something explodes &gt;!and a kid is on the ground dying!&lt;. And that's all I remember from that one. No idea how anything happens on these movies, I only remember some still frames or 1-2 scenes. Then there are a few I remember nothing at all. I think this is because I really wasn't excited for watching these movies at all. They didn't glue me to the screen. And I was pausing every 20 minutes to take a break or not paying attention.

Does this happen with anyone? The thing is, right now I'm torn. Part of me thinks this is good enough. I took away from watching all these movies those that I like the most, and that's what matters.

777,Which film critic buzzwords do you find to be the most overused / annoying?,"It seems like there are certain buzzwords that just get thrown around all the time to describe movies. 

One that really annoys me is when people use the word ""gritty"" ... I don't really know why, this shit just annoys me. ""This movie is so D A R K and G R I T T Y"" like goddamn stfu. I see people throwing the word gritty around basically to describe any movie that involve magic or superpowers. Like remember when people were calling the Dark Knight trilogy ""gritty"" ? I mean c'mon, the term has no meaning at this point. If the Dark Knight is gritty, that means basically every movie is gritty. Wtf does gritty even mean at this point? If you're going to describe a far fetched movie about a cartoony murder clown as gritty, then the word has lost all meaning.

Edit: I'm aware of the new wave of criticism of the movie but I personally still love it, and am interested to hear from those who still love it why they do. Personally, one of my top reasons is its poignant reminder that no one (save maybe our parents?) can give us the certainty of eternal love:

**Tom: ""I need to know that you're not gonna wake up in the morning and feel differently.""**

**Summer: ""And I can't give you that. Nobody can.""**

784,"Which is your favorite ""hyperlink cinema"" film?","By this, I am asking which movie is your favorite that focuses on different stories that do connect/interact in some way. For example, the film later releaving a character from the 1st story does get to see or meet the character from the 3rd story and maybe their interaction causes something to happen in their story. Do not confuse this for a anthology movie, which is seperate films/stories put together into 1 movie.

For me, that would be Sin City (2005). This is my favorite comic book film ever.

The presentation is absolutely fantastic. It's unique, creative, well-shot, well-lit, and perfectly captures that feel of a comic book story. I also really love the use of silhouettes in the movie. It haves among my favorite visuals in any film. I just love the whole style of this movie. The characters are also very interesting, well-designed and have interesting stories that keep you hooked. Also, that cannibal killer antagonist is just fucking terrifying. I think he gave my favorite performance in this film. The performance and the presentation really portrayed how evil this man is. The dialogue is also very fun and memorable. Sure, it's super blunt, cheesy and edgy but intentionally so as it is playing with the noir style. Some of the visuals (mainly the clearly CGI cars) look laughable but I find it acceptable as the story is supposed to be cartoonish and over-the-top with its presentation and stories, which I think it succeeded pretty well.

806,Has anyone begun to notice the same patterns in movies and developed the habit of not wanting to watch one unless it has a good rating?,"I used to enjoy literally any movie without the need to know its rating or reviews. But lately, I started to feel that a movie isn't worth watching unless it has good reviews. 

The reason for this is because I started to notice that the plots of most movies nowadays usually fall into the same fixed patterns. For example, literally any action movie starring The Rock starts with the 'initial fighting scene', then follows by some dialogues or explanation regarding the situations (usually there is some mission that seems impossible to carry out), then a failed attempt 'fighting scene' regarding the mission, and finally 'the final fighting scene' that successfully finish the mission at antagonist's main base. Any action movie under 7.0 imdb rating follows this pattern.

Other genres too have their own fixed patterns. For example, a zombie or apocalypse movie would have this exact same plot. The root of the virus, non critical spread to a nearby town, then the serious situation where everybody in the city dies, then some actions of protagonists trying to resolve or escape the thing, and finally the ending where they eventually find a small survival community.

I know that they are still many underrated good movies out there but when you see these patterns too often you just get bored of them. So, I began constantly criticizing any movie I watch and I feel like a movie isn't worth watching unless it completely revolutionize the heck out of it related genres. I just can't get myself to enjoy a normal movie with a normal rating without criticizing for its flaws anymore and I seriously need your help.",movies,"Has anyone begun to notice the same patterns in movies and developed the habit of not wanting to watch one unless it has a good rating?

811,Godzilla as a remake: how to analyze the differences between the original and the new ones?,"How can we analyze, comparatively, what the original says about its context and world view, versus the new ones? What different utterances or statements can we find in each one?

If the original film used the monster as a metaphor for the nuclear bomb and represented Japan as an innocent nation, a victim of the atrocities committed towards them, how are these issues treated in the American version? What do the producers, directors and screenwriters of the new versions do about the statements of the original? What does the new ones say about the relationship between the United States and Japan?  Personally, I think the American version follows the formula of the  original Japanese films, portraying Godzilla's transition from natural  disaster to humanity's best defender. However, I had the feeling that Gareth Edwards and his team uses Godzilla's story to make kind of a war movie (and pro military at that). The issue is that, in the Japanese original, Godzilla was an Other (product of the American crimes related to atomic bombs) that had a touching but necessary death (that's why Ishirô Honda putts dramatic music in that scene in the original). In this one the role of Godzilla its not clear: he is a monster, but a good one. However, there are other monsters that are bad. What is the difference between them? What is the position of Godzilla (2014) on the concept of monsters? It seems that the answer is: the other should be tolerated as long as their interests do not clash with ours.

Recently, I edited the first part of two videos about this topic. I'll leave the first part down here. I would like to read your opinions on the subject in the comments!

814,"Last night I watched ""Beautiful Boy""","I always avoided films with Timothée Chalomet because they seemed to be fluffy, and maybe I was a little jealous of his jaw and hair. Anyway, I decided to watch this film last night because I have been struggling with addiction myself. I don't actually even watch movies anymore, I spend most of my free TV time watching cartoons. Anyway, I was really taken with Beautiful Boy. It was a very painful meditation on addiction, its wonton disregard for personal health, and its affect on the people close to the addict. I cried almost the whole time. And I think, maybe, remembering those characters will help me stay off dangerous drugs. 

I would definitely recommend this movie because it was a meaningful, acted well, with a beautiful  soundtrack. But TBH I'm not sure anybody wants all that negativity unless they need it. So if you or someone you love needs some perspective on their partying habits, maybe check out Beautiful Boy.

817,Looking for a movie. Watched as a kid.,"So let me begin with why and how I don't remember this movie. Watched it on either Hbo or Cinemax 15 years ago. Growing up in a Catholic household anything remotely strange on tv. Would be quickly turned off. So I only watched half it maybe.

What I remembered:

A boy is relocated due to his mother passing away or either because she's unfit to be a mother. Or maybe even abandoned. 

Ends up living with his aunt or uncle, who already have a family of their own. There's immediate friction between the boy and the family. Very bad. The parents of the family for having to support an additional child with such short notice. Then his cousins who hate him for pretty much existing. So they're is constant bullying, even the parents kinda jump in as well.
At some point he either finds out that his mom is alive or maybe it's another family member of his. He finds out through the phone. He decides to look for them.

He comes up with the plan of leaving. Running away he ends up somehow on the road. Near the dessert. On a long 2 lane that goes both directions. I forget how it happens but he ends up getting a car. There's a scene where he is driving and at some point a police cruiser ends up tailing him. He's scared but doesn't react. The police car approaches next to him, see's him and does nothing. Keeps going. 

(In the last explanation, some things might be in the wrong order but that's how I remember it) 

The boy continues to drive. He then laters ends up meeting an older girl with blonde hair. In her mid 20s or so. Who he finds comfort in. He befriends her and trust her. (I forgot to mention this but he at some point ends up getting a box of raisins. On this box is a picture of a beautiful blonde lady, he cherishes this box of raisins due to the picture) the girl he meets reminds him of the girl on the box. 

He tells her his story and what he's been through. She feels sorry for him and they take a plane flight. 

That's where my memory ends of the movie. They're might be something I missed. Or gotten wrong. For one, the flight might've been before he runs away. He might've been on a vacation flight with his new family. And some how gets lost on purpose. To escape. 



Well thanks in advance. Hope I got everything that I can remember. Sometimes I think to myself wether I actually saw this movie or I dreamt it.

821,THEORIES ON In the Tall Grass™,"Sorry bad english

In In the Tall Grass™ we know nothing about the grass. The grass is mystical yes, mysterious yes, realistic no. 

Now let's talk about the grass. I personally think the grass is actually a portal in time. The evidence I have is the one line one character said "" you tried left but didn't go left instead right but you didn't go right you ran straight instead but all concludes you run into me"" (or something like that). Now what we deduce from this line is the grass can give you different outcomes. It's like as if different timelines try to collide into one thus giving them the illusion of being moved by the grass. On one of the first scenes we see a scene where they said they weren't moving and jumped upwards. They jumped normally on the first time and then the second time the person was further. Maybe there was a timeline where he did not stop moving instead he moved or ran backwards.
The grass is many things but alive is not one of them

Mesmerizing and grotesque at he same time, it was one of those rare where I had to pause and whisper ""WTF"" to myself and check for the remaining time, wishing for the final act to put me out of my misery. But at the same time, engulfed in some perverse fascination I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. So, go check out this exhilarating mind fuck of a movie.

This might just be Sion Sono's magnum opus. Talking about this movie brings another magnum opus hogging all the limelight, Scorsese's Irishman. Both internationally renowned filmmakers allowed to run free.",1
824,The cinematography of Fight Club,"Can we have a thread to discuss this? Why isn't this movie's cinematography more acknowledged or talked about? This is the one 1999 film that, when I'm watching it, actually *looks like* a much newer, much more modern film. I'm not sut if it's the quality of the image, the color correction, the angles, or what, but it feels like it could easily be a 2006-2010 movie. comparing it to other movies from around that time (american beauty, american psycho, memento, office space, being john malkovich, the matrix, the truman show, saving private ryan), this one stands out a lot, there's something that feels inherently modern about this film.

Does anyone else feel this way? Are there other movies that feel a lot more modern than they are?

828,I want Will Smith in a Christopher Nolan movie.,"I was just rewatching Inception and I remembered that Nolan originally offered the role of Cobb to Will before getting Leo. And now that I think about it, I think he would have done a great job. Absolutely nothing against Leo whatsoever, I think he was great as well but I think Will also could have brought something interesting to it. If you've seen Focus, Will can definitely play an alpha sort of professional and in his favor, he'd do a good job as an Extractor. 

With that said, Will Smith's movies recently have been mediocre but I think he's a pretty great actor who's just one awesome film away to being more relevant and appreciated as an actor (mind you, he's more of a celebrity at this point if that makes sense, the way he promotes himself on social media). I saw Gemini Man and while it was pretty mediocre (I wish I saw it in HFR), it really reminded me how great Will Smith is as an actor when he pushes himself. And Christopher Nolan's movies are wonderful spectacles so utilizing Will Smith in them could amplify and help his needs as an action hero but still, at the core, be a sort of character study. 

Anyways, I know this sub doesn't like Will Smith but I can't help BUT like him.",movies,"I want Will Smith in a Christopher Nolan movie.

836,[Spoilers] Why did The Aftermath get so many negative reviews?,"Just watched it on a plane, and I was shocked to see it had such poor reviews. Sure, it wasn't the most amazing movie I've ever seen, but I thought the acting was great, the plot was believable, and the setting of post-surrender Germany was interesting (e.g. I had never thought about people like the 88s existing).

I definitely thought the relationship between Knightley and Clarke's characters was strange, with some tension that doesn't make sense - until later in the movie, when they reveal that he didn't come home after their son died, even though he could have. Their relationship didn't break down while she was with him in Germany, it had already broken down. This makes clear the contrast between her husband and the German: while her husband has completely shut down after the death of their son, the German mourned his wife but continued on, still emotionally available to his daughter and caring for her.

At the end, she goes back to her husband because she realizes that he was just as affected by their son's death as she was, and that they could make it work because they were feeling the same pain. He wasn't cold or uncaring, he was just broken, like her.

I found this storyline compelling, and along with the acting, the movie certainly doesn not seem deserving of the scores/reviews it received.

So, what did you guys think? Have I mentioned anything as a positive that you didn't like, or have a failed to see a downside that you saw clearly?

Side note, I thought the way they executed the attempted assassination was well done. After getting into that argument at the dinner/gala/whatever, he was angry and opted to drive the car, which ended up saving his life. It was dark on that wooded road, so the 88 probably couldn't see who was where in the car and probably assumed the husband would be in the passenger seat. If she hasn't said anything to him and they had driven home normally, he would've died.

858,"If you’re curious about the comfort women issue between Japan and Korea, I really recommend checking out Miki Dezaki’s film “Shusenjo” which just came out.","Tried posting this to r/japan but the heads of basically told me he couldn’t be fucked to moderate a thread about comfort women because it was too much work and the typhoon was top priority.

The comfort issue is one that often gets talked about as the single biggest hurdle in diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea. As such, it’s been part of a huge amount of historical revisionism on both the left and right wing. Admittedly, I myself had fallen victim to some of these talking points that you see on Reddit, particularly on this subreddit. I’d seen people comment “Japan’s apologised several times to Korea over comfort women! This is just efforts by Korea to antagonise Japan” Sadly, I had accepted some of that as true, thinking that Japan had really properly apologised. 

Today, I had the opportunity to meet with Dezaki sensei at a screening of the film and was absolutely blown away by how well put together it was and how much I learnt from it. The connections between Abe’s cabinet and Nippon Kaigi, or Abe’s essential refute of the Kono statement of 93, in which Japan did promise to teach the proper history of its imperial actions in Korea, Abe’s connection to far right wing revisionist groups, etc. 

The film is still screening across Japan and Korea in some independent cinemas and I really recommend you check it out if you can, even if you think you have your mind made, just to have your views questioned. I’ve included some articles about the film too, including how the director is being sued by far right nationalists regarding it:

Tried posting this to r/japan but the heads of basically told me he couldn’t be fucked to moderate a thread about comfort women because it was too much work and the typhoon was top priority.

The comfort issue is one that often gets talked about as the single biggest hurdle in diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea. As such, it’s been part of a huge amount of historical revisionism on both the left and right wing.

And although there are some genre's that have remained strong, horror has been one that is just fading in my opinion. The label ""horror"" has been thrown around movies that are, although good, not scary at all. Take *The Quiet Place* for example, it's a decent film, but it's just not scary. *IT* is another example of this, it's a good film, but honestly, it's more of a comedy than a horror film. For god sakes, *Slenderman* was an absolute joke of a film.
But here is the worst thing. Because the Horor genre has been oversaturated with bad shit, good ol classic Horor Films are suffering from it. *The Shining* a film that was scary as hell when I first watched it, is just good now, not scary, just good. At this point, those old films that I was once terrified of, do nothing. I watch horror films now, and the scenes that are supposed to be scary eithier make me laugh from how terrible they are, or make me feel nothing. I know that some people are more scared than others when it comes to movies, but what about people like me, who want to scream and run away from the tv because the film is just scary as shit. 
Now, as some might have noticed, I've only mentioned american films, mostly because that's were my focus was for so long. I'm trying International horror films now, and my hope is to find an actual horror film.

867,Was the ending of Chef (2014) circular?,"I recently watched Chef, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(2014_film), for the first time. I overall enjoyed the film, but found the ending odd. Needless to say spoilers from this point forward....

So through dialog in the movie we learn Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) was once seen as an up and coming chef. At some point after receiving positive press for his cooking, the owner of the restaurant where Casper works at the start of the movie hired him.

The owner (Dustin Hoffman) apparently supported him. The kitchen in the restaurant was really nice and the owner mentioned how he purchased highly quality gear at Casper's request. The staff also seems to be quite competent and capable. I can't quite remember the details, but it seems like Casper brought in people he knew previous to working at the restaurant (e.g. the owner gave Casper the authority to build out his own team).

So the initial act of the movie shows that Casper has gotten into a rut. He has been cooking the same thing over and over for years and when he hears a food critic is coming to review his menu, he wants to spice it up. This conflicts with what the owner wants to do, this goes back and forth, and long story short it ends with Casper screaming at the critique and going off to do soul searching.

In his soul searching he purchases a food truck and reconnects with his love of cooking (and his son and ex-wife) as he now has full creative control of what he is cooking.

At the end of the movie the food critic comes to him and tells him his food is great and that he wants to go into business with him on a restaurant. Also he re-marries his wife (Sofía Vergara).

Isn't this somewhat circular? The movie starts at the end of Casper's relationship with the owner of the restaurant, but it seems like their relationship started this same way. The owner of the restaurant brought him in because he's a really good chef and gave him a lot of support to do his job. Also, presumably, he was still married to his wife when he initially started working at the first restaurant.

Overall enjoyed Chef, it has its faults (the biggest is the relationship with his ex-wife doesn't make much sense), but also some charm as well. Just found the end particularly confusing, especially if you have been paying attention to the plot/dialog of the movie.",movies,"Was the ending of Chef (2014) circular?

One of Gilligan’s quotes from the article:

&gt;I didn’t get super far down the road, but it was probably going to be a young woman who needed some help,” he says. “He was hiding out by the Canadian border, and this woman was working at a motel as a housekeeper or something.  [He] goes into the process of saving her, knowing full well that he’s going to suffer for it, he’s going to get caught for it, but he does it anyway. And the last scene would be maybe him in a jail cell but at peace for the first time since the movie began. I think there was going to be this component where he couldn’t sleep. He wouldn’t get a single night sleep for a week or so upon escaping. The police are looking for him and he’s too haunted and he’s too adrenaline-charged. And at the end of the thing, he’s in a jail cell, and ironically he can fall asleep like a baby. And I thought, ‘Ah, that’d be kind of cool.'”

Apparently Golligan’s partner as well as Peter Gould helped change his mind

I actually might like this ending more? Have to think about it.

**EDIT**:

More here.

&gt;**After Breaking Bad ended, you said that Jesse Pinkman was free, that he successfully got away. All these years, you maintained that. But I wondered if you had second thoughts as you started to write the movie. Were there other possibilities you considered?**
﻿
&gt;Yes, I did. I like irony in storytelling. I love ironic twists. Once I had set about coming up with this movie, for the longest time I had it in my mind that the thing we wanted most to see was for Jesse to escape. And the thing he wanted most to do was escape. So I was trying to concoct a plot in which, hero that he is, he saves somebody else — somebody I would have introduced as a new character into the movie. Because he’s such an innately heroic character in my mind, he saves someone at the end of the movie and he willfully gets himself caught knowing that it’ll save this other person. At the end of the movie, he’d be locked in a jail cell somewhere in Montana or someplace. And he would be at peace with it. It was all this very interior, emo-type, very dramatic stuff.

&gt;I pitched it to my girlfriend, Holly, and she said, “Are you out of your mind? You can’t have him in a jail cell at the end. You got to let him get away. People will riot.” I said, “No, don’t you get it? It’s art. It’s artistic.” And then I said, “No offense, you’re not a writer. I respect you, of course, and I love you. But you’re not a writer.” And then I went the next day and pitched it to Peter [Gould] and the writers of Better Call Saul, and they all looked at me in silence. They said, “Are you crazy? He’s got to get away at the end.” [Laughs.] As the saying goes, if enough people tell you you’re drunk, you need to sit down. So I dispensed with that idea.

&gt;**Had you worked out who this new character was going to be?**

&gt;I hadn’t quite worked it out. To my credit, I was kicking this idea around, but I didn’t get too far down the road with it. I didn’t actually start writing it, but I had some pretty definitive ideas. I spent a couple of weeks on that. But I’m glad I discarded it. Sometimes you succeed by giving people the opposite of what they want, but sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes you just got to give folks what they want.

As I prepare to rewatch the entire thing for the 10th year in a row, it really boggles my mind that no matter how many times I watch them, the sheer enjoyment and exhilaration of taking this journey never, ever gets old or any less fun than it did when I first watched it.

There are so many things that make these movies as rewatchable as they are - the actors who truly breathed life into their well-developed characters, the incredible production/art design and set pieces, the deep lore and worldbuilding, the gorgeous scenery etc. etc. What I  personally really find that stands out to me, and why they never seem to get old, is that feeling of adventure and continuously escalating stakes. The first movie is fairly low-stakes, starting off in the cozy Shire and following the characters through a series of narrow escapes and chase scenes. But the scope just continues to widen, not just in every movie, but pretty much every set piece, until it leads to an all-out war in the ROTK.

Whereas in all these newer CGI extravaganzas with all this new technology these worlds still look fake and cartoony, like the last Hobbit movie (same director too which makes it even more bizarre) for example, I felt like I was watching a videogame.

3. A random plot point I remember-ish is that a group of kids were stuck in a space capsule that was running out of air so they agreed not to talk but one kid wishes they had french fries (or something...) and some other kid said stop using the air.

947,1001 List Review: The Heiress,"The Heiress 1949

Plot Synopsis:

Catherine (Olivia de Havilland), a young woman who stands to inherit her father's large fortune, falls in love when she meets Morris (Montgomery Clift), who gives her the love and affection her father doesn't, and which she desperately needs. Catherine's father (Ralph Richardson), believing Morris is only after the money, tells Catherine she will be disinherited if she marries him. Morris' true intentions are put to the test when he finds out about the amended will.

 [https://imgur.com/a/GCCCVXz](https://imgur.com/a/GCCCVXz) 

My Take:

  
I always have a bit of difficulty getting fully invested into any movie I watch. This one drew me in without my even realizing it. I was embarrassed by the titular Heiress’s naivete, I was suspicious of the intentions of her suitor, I got a sick sense of amusement whenever her father pointed out she had almost no good qualities and many bad ones (which he does often). In short, I felt along with this movie, despite its age. I was going to chalk up the fact I liked it to simply being susceptible to melodrama due to years of watching *The Young and Restless* along with my parents during dinner, but I realized there was another reason; the main character wised up and grew and got her little piece of revenge at the end. It's not just some tragedy.

You will be embarrassed for the heiress at the beginning and cheer for her at the end, a sign of an enthralling narrative. Also note she didn’t have/want/need another man to replace the one who betrayed her at the end. The original story was written by a married couple, which probably played a part in how independent she became over the course of the story.

Context:

Film was released in 1949 and set in the 1850’s. Although, other than the peculiarities of courtship at the time, I’d say the events of the story are pretty timeless. Seeing how people operated in a courtship centered social space instead of a dating one is a bit of a culture shock, but the historical goings on at the time are ultimately unimportant to the story. That [Lucky Old Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3kvxN3xFc) by Frankie Laine was the number one song by sales in 1949. Obviously no data exists for 1850 for such a thing. [Samson and Delilah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_and_Delilah_(1949_film)) was the number one film that year.

949,Million Dollar Baby (2004). Clint Eastwood's neo-noir sports drama reminds us how films are best created.,"Currently watching Clint Eastwood's filmography for the first time. Never seen any of his work before. So far I've seen Mystic River, Gran Torino, and Million Dollar Baby.

What an amazing filmmaker he is. His style is like an entirely new genre of cinema that I've never experienced.

Million Dollar Baby is truly one of the best films I have ever seen and I say that without any hesitation. The film is just so excellent at depicting characters with clarity and truth. I sat in silence for the entire length of the film because I was drawn so deeply into the lives of Maggie and Frankie that I was unable to comprehend that I was even watching a movie. The experience was unparalleled.

Everything was just so real. Clint Eastwood pays attention to the films supporting characters, who make the surrounding world feel incredibly genuine.

The dialogue is masterful. Hilary Swank is nothing short of electrifying in every scene she's in. The way she carries Maggie with a particular intensity and deep attentive gaze completely blew me away.

edit: she won an academy award for this performance. not surprised.

The cinematography is sensational. Characters' faces would slide in and out of shadow. The use and disuse of lighting was wonderfully obedient to the tone of each scene.

I could not recommend a film more highly. What a remarkable movie.",movies,"Million Dollar Baby (2004). Clint Eastwood's neo-noir sports drama reminds us how films are best created.

951,*Before Sunrise*,"So I tried watching Before Sunrise two years back and I just ended it after they got off the train and thought that it might be some kind of a boring movie. Well after two years, I watched Before Sunrise today. And this movie is amazing on so many levels. It just made me connect. No thriller, nothing. Just two individuals on a journey of life. Happening to meet one another. Having a connection. Discussing things that at this point of my life I wanted to discuss it with someone. Having the time of their life in just one day. I mean its amazing. The way they layer by layer express themselves to one another, slowly remove the boundaries they had created. Its all so beautiful. And on the other hand this film itself is so calming. Like so much calming I can't even describe. This just dawned upon me that how only one day can make or break you. They just had a day to themselves. And all they could do was just build up their connection. And at the end they had to part.
Slipping a little bit away from the movie, I think that we all kind of incomplete in some way. We need people who can understand us, who can give us healthy criticism, who can indulge in our fantansies with us!! We all need someone in sort of any relationship that might be. It doesn't always need to be a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship. You just need someone who can have a heart to heart with you!!

PS. I was 15 two years back and I totally wouldn't have understood it back then like I did today. Because I'm a changed person now. And my outlook on life has changed. We all evolve as the years go by!! It was surely a good time now to come across this movie!!

It doesn't always need to be a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship. You just need someone who can have a heart to heart with you!!

PS. I was 15 two years back and I totally wouldn't have understood it back then like I did today. Because I'm a changed person now. And my outlook on life has changed. We all evolve as the years go by!! It was surely a good time now to come across this movie!!

960,What are the best comedy movies of all time?,"I love Elf as a Christmas film and think it’s Will Ferrell’s best. I would also suggest people to watch Some Like It Hot for an old comedy, it’s a great movie that stands the test of time, but Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is my personal favorite. Steve Martin and John Candy are both great in the movie, and the message really shines through, to a point where I think the performances and emotional impact elevates the film over other comedies in its genre. I know a lot of people would say Ferris Bueller or The Breakfast Club is Hughes’ best film, but I believe it’s PT&amp;A. To me, it’s a timeless holiday classic that’s aged well compared to most comedies of the era. 

For more raunchy comedies, I’d also highly recommend The Forty Year Old Virgin, Superbad, and There’s Something About Mary. For anyone who liked Superbad, Pineapple Express is also really hilarious. The Cornetto Trilogy is also very good: Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and The World’s End are all solid comedy movies. For anyone who enjoys the Coen Brothers, I’d suggest that you watch The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading if you didn’t already. Groundhog Day is another movie that I‘d say, is a level above most comedies; the premise and story are great, and I believe it’s Bill Murray’s best movie and performance. 

I’m not big into Adam Sandler comedies, but hey, I thought Happy Gilmore was decent. I recently rewatched the first Austin Powers movie, and thought it aged surprisingly well. For romantic comedies, When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral were really good too.

964,Which Are The Best Victim Characters In Horror Films?,"Horror films are notorious for generally having very disposable and unlikable characters with no much personality to them. They are mostly just there to be killed by the serial killer and to try to survive. However, there are at times where there are victims in horror films that are compelling and have far more depth to them than average victim character.

One of my favorite examples are Mima Kirigoe from ""Perfect Blue"", who despite being part of the trope of the ""innocent girl become mature"", she does go beyond that. Mima is a character who, while acts stereotypically like a good girl, does surprisingly have more humanity to her and does have her more conflicting and darker thoughts, which is shown through the fake Mima, which represents her self-doubt, self-judgement, her desire to hold to her past and other feelings that she keeps inside her but at the same time, a side in her that taunts her. While she cares about others and wants to help, she also desires something better for herself and she doesn't feel happy at all with what she doesn't. She doesn't always accept being part of tjis contribution and that makes her hold a grudge for herself even getting involved in something that she feels will make her be seen in an negative way by society and also a grudge for the people she is trying to help for contributing for the change in her career and persona. She is far more complex than many victim characters that you typically see in horror.

And there's Carrie White from 1976's ""Carrie"". Although, I am fairly conflicted by choosing her since she is kinda practically the villian as she is responsible for the horror that occurs later. However, she is definitely portrayed as a victim in the movie. A victim of bullying, abuse from her mother, the shame of her sexuality and gender and trauma, which leads her into causing the prom massacre. Not to mention that her crazy, religious mother tries to kill her at the end. She is one of my favorite female characters in film.",movies,"Which Are The Best Victim Characters In Horror Films?

982,I did not enjoy Ad Astra.,"Don't get me wrong, there were some parts of the movie that I really liked. I loved the opening scene on the space tower. The effects and lighting choices were top-notch throughout. The Mad Max chase on the moon was really fun. The scene in the comms room on Mars was excellent.

However, there were way too many parts of the movie that bugged me for me to fully buy into it.

- The voice-over narration. It felt really clunky and unnecessary almost every time.
- The space monkeys. Not only is that scene really absurd, but it has no bearing on the plot, and feels like it's only in the movie to add one more action scene.
- The scene where...
    1. The protagonist sneaks onboard a rocket by climbing up the side during the launch countdown.
    2. When he gets onboard, every member of the crew immediately whips out a space-gun.
    3. Within 30 seconds, all three of them accidentally kill themselves.
- During the space walk back to his shuttle, why did he rocket himself towards it so fast that he painfully bounced off of it several times? I couldn't help but laugh when that happened.
- Why did he use the nuke to propel himself home? It was never established that there was any kind of fuel shortage for the mission, and that seems insanely risky.",movies,"I did not enjoy Ad Astra.

I always thought that M was the true *bond girl* in this film, and that the theme is an ode to her and Bond's relationship.   I've picked out a few lines I thought represented this, as well as listed a link to the song and the lyrics below. 

* *Let the sky fall / When it crumbles / We will stand tall / Face it all together / At skyfall*: After the bombing of MI6, the sky is falling per se for Bond and M. They will work together to stop the villain, ultimately bringing them to Bond's childhood home of Skyfall.
* *You may have my number, you can take my name / But you'll never have my heart:* Bond is loyal to M, but will always have a fraught personal relationship with her. 
* *Where you go I go / What you see I see / I know I'd never be me / Without the security / Of your loving arms / Keeping me from harm:* Bond is under M's care, for better or worse. Points out the irony of Bond getting hit by the risky gunshot at the beginning of the film that M authorized.
* *Put your hand in my hand / And we'll stand:* A reference to the showdown at Skyfall at the end of the film. Regardless of what happens and his feelings, Bond still pledges to stand by M's side.

Feel the earth move and then  
Hear my heart burst again

Swept away, I'm stolen

Where worlds collide and days are dark

But you'll never have my heart

Keeping me from harm  
Put your hand in my hand

999,"Her (2013) - A film I wanted to watch, and I still do after watching it","First and foremost - what an incredible film. 


After hearing the relationship between Lost in Translation and this movie, I wanted to watch this. Apparently it's two sides of the same story, and since Lost in Translation is my current favourite movie, I felt like I had to. 


But just saying it's a movie made solely for Jonze to redeem himself after Sofia Coppola's ""accusation"" of him being a boring dorky man in Lost in Translation, that would do the movie no justice. 


The movie revolves around Theodore Twombly looking for a restart of his life after a break-up that got him all teared up. He finds comfort in an Operating System (OS), a revolutionary AI to accompany people in their daily lives. His OS calls herself Samantha, and it doesn't take long until their relationship surpasses a simply professional one.


First of all I was charmed by the use of colour in this movie; above all, the colour red. It's omnipresent throughout the scenes and it will stay with me as an immediate association I have with that colour for sure.      
The cinematography, and I know it's cliché to talk about it, is gorgeous. I've never felt like wanting a different camera perspective in any scene.      
I haven't seen any other movie starring Joaquin Phoenix, so for me this actor is still fresh. I could not compare it to another movie. But what an actor he is - not only did I feel for Theodore, I want to go as far as saying I wish I was a friend of his. 
Then there is Scarlett, who is almost as powerful as she was in Lost in Translation but without actually appearing on screen. She is the only thing in the movie that reminds me Lost in Translation and Her are related in a way. That does not take away any enjoyment, though.        
The story is so neatly pieced together, completely based on one concept: when are computers more than just computers? After all, we humans also think in 1's and 0's, and so do they. Computers are the children of humanity, and children should grow up to surpass their parents, shouldn't they? But at the same time, can we stand the thought of us human beings having deep emotional connection to something that's - in a sense - not-human at all, and should it be viewed as a kind of bestiality? The subject this film touches on set me to think a lot. I recently read the collection of stories by Asimov, I, Robot, that are all about the human-computer relationship. The feelings I got from the book and this movie were very similar and that's a compliment for Spike Jonze, that he took matters and worked them out as deeply as the late Asimov did, an icon in science-fiction.         
But eventually it all comes down to being a beautiful love story, and I don't mean that as a bad thing. You root for Samantha and Theo just as much as you root for any other couple in a romance movie. Maybe even more because both get so much more dimension than your average rom-com roles. Samantha and Theo do have something special together, how unlikely that seems if you look at the nature of their relationship on it's surface.         
Yes, the movie can be slow at times, with parts that are just music-driven slideshows of Theodore walking around without any plot-progression, but if you are a fan of character-driven movies you will not find that an issue as every shot of Theodore makes him slightly more likable, every sound of Samantha's voice makes her a bit more real, and every shot of their surroundings increases your understanding in what kind of a world they live in - a world not that different from ours. 


The film is a must-watch for any fan of romance. It did leave me with a few questions that I might be able to answer after a second viewing - I won't discuss them here, though, because they would spoil a lot of the movie.


I'm pretty sure r/movies hates people admiring the same movies over and over and I know how much love there is for this movie on here - but I just wanted to put my thoughts onto paper and I thought I'd review it, because I'm full of it. I did not cry, unfortunately, and I felt like at times I could've if I tried to, but I guess it wasn't terrible enough of a day for rain.


I'm not sure yet if I prefer to watch this over Lost in Translation. The latter is a lot easier to watch and doesn't get as vulgar as Her, but at the same time doesn't dip as deep in the pool or take me on such an amazing trip. I like both movies a lot and would recommend both of them to anyone.

1009,Entertainment (2015),"Saw a recent On Cinema episode, looked up a Tim Heidecker interview about Mister America, then fell down a Rick Alverson rabbit hole and borrowed Entertainment (2015) from the internet because I sorta enjoyed The Comedy (2012).  Has anybody else seen Entertainment?  I need to talk.

I think I hated this movie.

Endless stunning shots of landscapes and interesting dirty interiors and pretty much no story of any kind.  Every single opportunity to build turning points in a scene, much less to build a sequence of related scenes to a multi-scene crescendo, is squandered as they move onto the next event.  Michael Cera shows up, there's a great suspenseful build-up to something, then  nothing happens.

Turkington's cousin is a well-meaning dickhead, we build and build on that, and then nothing comes of it.

He leaves a thousand voicemails for his daughter, and that's never paid off in any way.

In good film, scenes exist for a reason.  Characters enter a scene with one emotional tone and leave with another.  One scene motivates characters further into a sequence (a set of related scenes) that pays off several scenes down the line.  Characters come into a situation with a certain intent but turning points send them in a direction they never expected.  In Entertainment, our protagonist refuses to take action at every turn and the most emotional scene in the movie, his last performance, has no effect on any other scene.  What the hell, Alverson?

If you don't feel like talking about Entertainment (2015), or if you haven't seen it, what movie makes you want your two hours back?",movies,"Entertainment (2015) Saw a recent On Cinema episode, looked up a Tim Heidecker interview about Mister America, then fell down a Rick Alverson rabbit hole and borrowed Entertainment (2015) from the internet because I sorta enjoyed The Comedy (2012).  Has anybody else seen Entertainment?  I need to talk.

I think I hated this movie.

Endless stunning shots of landscapes and interesting dirty interiors and pretty much no story of any kind.  Every single opportunity to build turning points in a scene, much less to build a sequence of related scenes to a multi-scene crescendo, is squandered as they move onto the next event.  Michael Cera shows up, there's a great suspenseful build-up to something, then  nothing happens.

Turkington's cousin is a well-meaning dickhead, we build and build on that, and then nothing comes of it.

He leaves a thousand voicemails for his daughter, and that's never paid off in any way.

Please help!","Last fall my BF and I watched a horror flick that we *cannot find* anywhere, on any platform, no matter what keywords we use. We’ve both spent literally hours dredging the internet and as we don’t know the title, we cannot find the movie anywhere. I’ll describe it below as best I can remember in hopes that someone will recognize it and know the name! 

First and foremost- it is entirely first person POV. Not found footage! It as if the camera is just stuck in the main character’s head and it never moves. 

The main character is a young woman on summer break from college in her sleepy home town. She meets up with two friends, a guy and a girl, and they smoke pot in the woods. It is the Fourth of July, or at least there is a fireworks celebration that night. Lots of POV shots of her cellphone in her hand. 

They go to the celebration and during the fireworks it is announced that a young girl is missing, and there’s some kind of curfew, so they make home. They stop at a party and drink, eventually she ends up home. The killer is inside her house and the first of many many scuffles ensues. I think at this point she’s texting her brother to stay away. She runs to a neighbors house and then out into the town. 

In the final 20 minutes or so, in running from the killer, she is hit by a car. The killer starts chasing her again and she runs into a gas station, and he follows. Shots were fired? Possibly? Either way the movie ends with her stabbing the shit out of the killer as the police blast into the gas station yelling to have her hands up. Again, all 100% POV and not in the found footage sort of way.

1039,1001 List Review: West Side Story,"West Side Story 1961

So I’m taking a mini retirement and decided to add yet another movie review post no one asked for to the list. During my weeks/months of time away from work, I'm aiming to watch one movie a day from the list of [1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/1001+movies+you+must+see+before+you+die/). I’m mostly doing the write-ups to keep myself mentally engaged and from doing literally nothing all day, which is my true heart’s desire. I’m an accountant by trade (no really) so my opinions are beyond unqualified. Feel free to disagree, you’ll probably educate me.

Plot Synopsis:

A musical in which a modern day Romeo and Juliet are involved in New York street gangs. On the harsh streets of the upper west side, two gangs battle for control of the turf. The situation becomes complicated when a gang members falls in love with a rival's sister.

[https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-film-classic-3o7aTm3qSAdSfwzVkY](https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-film-classic-3o7aTm3qSAdSfwzVkY)

My Take:

The story follows Tony and Maria, star-crossed lovers who meet at a 50’s dance but cannot be together because of Maria’s brother’s grudge against Tony’s former gang, the Jets. Maria’s brother, Bernardo, is the leader of the rival gang the Sharks. The actual plot plays out just as tawdry and melodramatic as real Romeo and Juliet feels nowadays. From my skimming Wikipedia the music pushed a lot of boundaries at the time and for the most part it’s pretty excellent and kept me engaged with the movie, despite how cheesy everything is. Most of the characters are much better dancers than actors; I assume that is due to the fact it was seen as a musical first and not because, say, acting wasn’t invented yet or something. An exception is Rita Moreno, who is pretty darn good at both. She won an academy award so someone 60 years ago agreed with me on that. That being said everyone that sings that aren’t the main two range from “okay” to “kill me”.

Altogether it was a really fun experience of theater translated to film, except for the schlocky parts. But even then it was definitely worth watching and experiencing. No regrets.

Context:

Billboard Hot 100 number-one single at the time was [Hit the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8Tiz6INF7I) Jack by Ray Charles, which goes to show popular musical taste at the time. It makes sense why the music in the play could have been thought of as too challenging.The play premiered during times of rising gang violence, which probably helped it stay relevant. [Brown vs Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) took place three years prior which probably helped inform the themes of “Us vs Them” racial tension, even though the Sharks are Puerto Rican, not Black.

1041,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil," CGI action is a plague on this movie, as it descends slowly down the spiral to an MCU style 'big finish' battle. Much money was spent on it no doubt, but watching it you find yourself asking 'why?'.

Why has hollywood not realised we are collectively bored of this yet?

1052,Where parodies went wrong. It is not about pop culture. It is about telling a story.,"I am as of right now watching Dracula Dead and Loving it and it reminds me of the practically dead genre of parody movies.

After Scary Movie 2, parody films became about how many pop culture references one can cram into a single movie. The movies became less about telling a cohesive story and more about ""Hey look! Remember this!? That is why it is funny! Because you remember this!"".

These jokes usually broke the film's pacing, style, and genre. Like in one of these films spoofing a part of Narnia, it suddenly became a hiphop song mimicking MTV's cribs. 

These got worse and worse as the films went on. It was all about mocking pop culture trends or long dead viral videos than it was about the primary film they were making fun on.

Taking the master of parody Mel Brooks; all his movies served as an actual storyline.  They all had a plotline with 3 proper acts with actual conflict and resolution.

The humor came from the characters' behavior and dialogue. Such as when Dracula tells the Usher to give a message to Dr Steward. But judt before she does so, he tells her that she will forget everything.

Comedy follows esp her delivery of 'No Tip!?'. The physical humor is not just 'fat guy falls down' but all with great timing and purpose. 

Men in tights has Robin playing the straight man in a world of goofs (never dumb or derpy. Just almost cartoony with their logic).

And of course you have AIRPLANE! Who matches all of these elements then combines it with fantastic background humor, witty and wonderful wordplay, and straight deliveries to absurb situations.

Even Cabin in the Woods plays it straight while providing humor on the mocking of horror tropes. My favorite being ""we should stick together...""

Guy gets sprayed with a chemical

""No...let's split up instead...""

We have great writers today and I am dying for another proper parody that does not rely on the internet, memes, and pop culture.

It finally seems like Derek's entire arch comes full circle getting Danny out of the life of being a skinhead and then boom his brother is senselessly murdered by someone who just so happens to be black. That ending always had me fear  that all of the good Derek had learned would go away and he would snap back into his skinhead beliefs after not only losing his father but now his brother. The alternate ending to me not only ruins the ambiguity emotional reaction, but also makes for a depressing outlook in general from the entire movie and makes Derek's character look weak.",1

1072,Can Anyone Tell Me the Name of Obscure Netflix Horror Movie...,"Google has turned up nothing and I've been searching for a while now. I saw it within the last few months but it isn't showing up in my watched titles and it's driving me crazy. 

So it's a movie that is a collection of short horror films, each one introduced by a short blurb with the background or origin of the tale. It's like the backstory for different cultures' legends or myths. The first one is super beautiful and is about two young German women, one brunette and one blonde, who see each other in the woods on the way to the creek to wash clothes with other women from the village. The young blonde is apparently pregnant, and the woman of the village seem to be gossiping about it because she appears unmarried (there is very little dialogue in this one, adding to the quiet unsettling vibe). The brunette ends up sneaking off into the woods to spend time with the blonde and gives her her blood-stained clothes to wash in the river so the women don't suspect the blonde of being pregnant anymore. They end up kissing and being spotted by the brunette's superstitious mother, who then makes her pray to some sort of effigy in the woods to not be gay/ possessed.  The brunette ends up having hallucinations/ nightmares about her mother being possessed, instead, and dreams of killing her (if I remember that part correctly?). She seems like she's losing her mind a little bit, not sleeping/ seeing things etc. Her and the blonde continue to meet up and frolic in the sylvan setting and the brunette basically accepts that she's gay/possessed and fast forward to her walking naked into the woods, fully embracing the demonic nature of things. Maybe she killed her mom, I don't quite remember.

Another short was a bunch of drunken Mediterranean men frolicking in, like, Krampus/ demon costumes for some holiday where the veil is thin. A demon comes to check them out in a hooded costume and the men end up finding him out and capturing him, making fun of the demon and abusing him a little bit. I think they make him show them the entrance to hell he crawled out of, and they just get drunker and rowdier the whole way there. There may be a boat they use to cross a body of water, using torches to light their way. I think one of the men ends up going through the gate to the underworld and it possibly shows him wandering by himself into a reddened sort of vague tunnel.

Aaaaaaaaaaand there is also a short (I think it was black and white?) where a man is walking through what looks like a forest, but he's walking around about 6 feet under the ground in a series of passageways. There he encounters a legit crazy woman who tells him he needs to eat 3 fresh-ish hearts and she'll grant him a wish or powers or something. The dude is all for it so when he sees someone get buried he waits and then digs up the corpse and busts out the heart (no easy feat, those ribs are tough) and mows down. Obviously this one is pretty graphic. He then finds like a small kid, and robs that grave, and a woman. I feel like the kid/ baby was the most difficult to watch. The woman in white appears (not quite a ghost because I think you can see her feet and she flails around in some strange trance/ dance) and actually I think she's his last victim. I feel like he killed her and then ate her heart and gained the powers she promised him. I forget how this one ended-- I know the authorities were investigating the plundered graves and hunting him down. 

Anyway! I really hope someone knows wtf I'm talking about because I'd love to show my friend this movie, and you'd be pretty surprised that ""German brunette and blonde lesbians possessed short film demons"" doesn't exactly turn up the results I'm looking for.  ;)",movies,"Can Anyone Tell Me the Name of Obscure Netflix Horror Movie...

1083,The Best Massive Battle - The Battle of the Helm's Deep?," I had a discussion with a friend of mine about massive battles seen in recent cinema. We were trying to name the best ones that make sense in their own universe and that are executet well. After going through a lot of battles from different genres (Sci Fi, History, Fanatasy) we both decided that the Hem's Deep was our favorite. The runner up was Kingdom of Heaven because it at least tried to show a historical siege and events during that battle made sense (it's not 100% accurate but I found it good enough).

The reason for choosing Helm's Deep is that the battle is just well rounded up without being 30 minutes of mindless slaughter. The pace is great, the timing of events is just superb to keep you on the edge and give you goosebumps. The last charge of Aragorn and Theoden is just full of emotions and makes sense considering their situtation.

1093,"Which Are Your Top 3 Favorite Horror Films Of All Time? And If You Want, You Can Explain Why Do You Enjoy Them.","We are close to Halloween so let's mention our favorite horror movies. My favorite horror movies are:

1. 
Perfect Blue (1997). It haves some of the best transitions I've seen in film which not only gives the film more style but also deliver information, show passage of time and also confuse you like the female protagonist and express her losing sense of time and reality, amazing attention to detail, talks about a lot of subjects that are still very relevant today and do connect to each other in some ways, some great clues, a great twist and some fairly interesting characters that also serve for the themes of the film. I also love how it plays with the idea of fantasy-reality and also describing what Mima is going through her life through the film as it shows a amazing way of breaking the 4th wall, comments on many things at the same time and tell the events occuring in the film, the protagonist's development, etc. The animation, while not perfect, is quite beautiful and makes the psychological horror feel more grounded and that more terrifying. It's also one of those you can watch everytime and learn something new from it. It is my 4th favorite film of all time and my favorite anime/animated film. Though, while I would say it's a pretty disturbing film, I find it more fascinating than disturbing. It's a great must-watch-multiple-times film. It does have some pretty surrealistic-like moments but it isn't supernatural at all but rather, it is psychological and it is very grounded in its horror. It also talks about many subjects and themes that are still very complex like the male gaze, identity, sexuality, fanaticism, mental illness, pressure, the movie/pop industry, the desire of living in the past, etc. They are all connected in some way and are explored in great depth. It's one of the most layered films I've ever seen.

2. 
American Psycho (2000). It's one of the most hilarious movies of all time, in my opinion. It is also very well-written, talks about a lot of nice subjects like the idea of consumerism, identity, conformity, self-worth, greed, the problems of capitalism, the shallowness of the 80's culture, and other social issues. It's also a disturbing movie despite its comedic tone. Christian Bale does one of the best performances for a villian and the villian Bale is playing is already a pretty fascinating character. Patrick Bateman is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time. His performance is not just super entertaining and expressive but it really serves on communicating of what the character is about and surprisingly, despite being over-the-top, there are actually some great subtleties to his performance. Not to mention that a lot of the movie is pretty quotable and memorable. I also just love the big irony of some of its scenes (like in the hookers scene where he talks about how much he loves a song for addressing the problems of abusive political authority when he is basically just doing that with them) and how over-the-top it is over such small things like the business card scene, which not only serves to be very funny but it helps on communicating just how shallow and ridiculous these men are and to show how Bateman really tries too hard on proving himself on having a better business card despite the business cards not looking all that different and also that the idea of business cards looking not much different also serves into communicating another theme/message of the film where other people confuse others for other people due to their self-indulgence.

I also really like the cinematography as it does really express that 80's feel to it and it does look ""nice, very nice"". The business card being especially well-directed and the first monologue scene having the perfect presentation as by giving it this feel of a beauty commercial, it exemplifies the themes of materialism and superficiality in the movie.

It's a pretty fun and smart movie. My favorite satire of all time. Sure, it is unrealistic and absurd but that's the point of the film and it is not exactly trying to be realistic. It is exagerrated but still making a good point with its judgement of capitalism and also making it fitting with its comedic, absurdist tone.

Carrie (1976). Amazing performance from Sissy Spacek, very likable characters, nice cinematography and the most endearing but at the same time, the most tragic horror film I've ever seen.",movies,"Which Are Your Top 3 Favorite Horror Films Of All Time? And If You Want, You Can Explain Why Do You Enjoy Them. We are close to Halloween so let's mention our favorite horror movies. My favorite horror movies are:

1. 
Perfect Blue (1997). It haves some of the best transitions I've seen in film which not only gives the film more style but also deliver information, show passage of time and also confuse you like the female protagonist and express her losing sense of time and reality, amazing attention to detail, talks about a lot of subjects that are still very relevant today and do connect to each other in some ways, some great clues, a great twist and some fairly interesting characters that also serve for the themes of the film. I also love how it plays with the idea of fantasy-reality and also describing what Mima is going through her life through the film as it shows a amazing way of breaking the 4th wall, comments on many things at the same time and tell the events occuring in the film, the protagonist's development, etc. The animation, while not perfect, is quite beautiful and makes the psychological horror feel more grounded and that more terrifying. It's also one of those you can watch everytime and learn something new from it. It is my 4th favorite film of all time and my favorite anime/animated film. Though, while I would say it's a pretty disturbing film, I find it more fascinating than disturbing. It's a great must-watch-multiple-times film. It does have some pretty surrealistic-like moments but it isn't supernatural at all but rather, it is psychological and it is very grounded in its horror. It also talks about many subjects and themes that are still very complex like the male gaze, identity, sexuality, fanaticism, mental illness, pressure, the movie/pop industry, the desire of living in the past, etc. They are all connected in some way and are explored in great depth. It's one of the most layered films I've ever seen.

2. 
American Psycho (2000). It's one of the most hilarious movies of all time, in my opinion. It is also very well-written, talks about a lot of nice subjects like the idea of consumerism, identity, conformity, self-worth, greed, the problems of capitalism, the shallowness of the 80's culture, and other social issues. It's also a disturbing movie despite its comedic tone. Christian Bale does one of the best performances for a villian and the villian Bale is playing is already a pretty fascinating character. Patrick Bateman is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time. His performance is not just super entertaining and expressive but it really serves on communicating of what the character is about and surprisingly, despite being over-the-top, there are actually some great subtleties to his performance. Not to mention that a lot of the movie is pretty quotable and memorable. I also just love the big irony of some of its scenes (like in the hookers scene where he talks about how much he loves a song for addressing the problems of abusive political authority when he is basically just doing that with them) and how over-the-top it is over such small things like the business card scene, which not only serves to be very funny but it helps on communicating just how shallow and ridiculous these men are and to show how Bateman really tries too hard on proving himself on having a better business card despite the business cards not looking all that different and also that the idea of business cards looking not much different also serves into communicating another theme/message of the film where other people confuse others for other people due to their self-indulgence.

I also really like the cinematography as it does really express that 80's feel to it and it does look ""nice, very nice"". The business card being especially well-directed and the first monologue scene having the perfect presentation as by giving it this feel of a beauty commercial, it exemplifies the themes of materialism and superficiality in the movie.

1117,"People are dismissing the Ariel casting because it's myth/folktale/legend so they should be able to cast whomever they choose. But if they were to take a creature from say an African culture and the casting were reversed, there would be backlash from those same people.","First off, I admit I was initially unhappy with the differing race casting of Ariel when I assumed they would be recreating the animated story that takes place off the coast of Denmark. Once they announced the story's setting is being changed to the Caribbean, the casting choice doesn't feel so out of place, and they are clearly deviating from the animated film so they should be able to cast whoever.

However, with searching through the unpopular opinions dealing with movie casting in regards to race/ethnicity, one of the biggest arguments I see a lot in regards to the Ariel black casting is that Ariel is a mermaid, a mythical creature built in folk-tale that is arguably entirely fiction. And even though the fairy-tale Disney based their animated movie off of is Danish, it doesn't matter what race she is because she's not a real, human character right? However, I feel that if Hollywood were to take a myth/legend/folk-tale from native African culture and change the characters to be white (or any other race), the same people that were arguing Ariel can be any race would throw their hands up in anger for suddenly ""white-washing"" a character, even if it fits that same criteria of Ariel for being a fictional, mythical creature.

I'll give an example. In the legends of the Ewe people of Ghana and Togo, there is a mythical creature known as the Adze. The Adze is a sort of ""vampire"" if you will that takes the form of a firefly. Upon capturing an Adze it will revert to a human-like form and attack. If Hollywood were to make a movie in Africa, depicting the Adze, people would most likely argue that the Adze should be played by a black person. But if we use the same argument that was used for Ariel, they should be able to cast whoever they want for the role based on acting prowess. As a person of Asian descent myself, if they were to say cast an Asian person for the Adze, I wouldn't feel empowered or more represented in the film industry. I would feel confused as to why they were changing a folk-lore just to pander to my people.

To roundabout what I initially said about my opinion on the Ariel casting. If they were to make a movie about the Adze and set it in Africa, I would prefer they stick to setting and cast a person of African descent.

1122,A Walk in the Woods (2015),"I have been a fan of Bill Bryson for a many years even since I read ""Notes from a Big Country"", I then read his book about England, Australia, The Woods and eventually the Universe but the one that stuck for me more than any was ""A Walk in The Woods"", something about the idea of walking the AT in the US sounds real exciting and romantic though I appreciate it is very much very far from that for people who do it and the romantic idea goes downhill (no pun intended) quickly.

So when I heard they were making a book based his novel A Walk in The Woods I really wanted to see it. I cannot claim to know much about Robert Redford (playing Bryson) or or that matter Nick Nolte (playing Katz) but I still wondered if they could pull it off. Redford was not how I imagined Bryson but to his credit he was good and given that almost no-one outside of Iowa knows Katz I had no clue what to expect but both I really enjoyed. There were bits in the film that were not in the book but I guess they had artistic licence and there was a a lot in the book missed in the film but given the length of the book and the time period it was written over this was to be expected.

I don't think this film will ever be that remembered. I am not sure AWITW is even Bryons best selling novel but as a film to capture a moment with stunning scenery, wonderful dialogue and a reminder that we can achieve things if only we are willing to try I think this is wonderful. I will never walk the AT but the book and film did make me want to be more outgoing so for that I am grateful",movies,"A Walk in the Woods (2015) I have been a fan of Bill Bryson for a many years even since I read ""Notes from a Big Country"", I then read his book about England, Australia, The Woods and eventually the Universe but the one that stuck for me more than any was ""A Walk in The Woods"", something about the idea of walking the AT in the US sounds real exciting and romantic though I appreciate it is very much very far from that for people who do it and the romantic idea goes downhill (no pun intended) quickly.

So when I heard they were making a book based his novel A Walk in The Woods I really wanted to see it. I cannot claim to know much about Robert Redford (playing Bryson) or or that matter Nick Nolte (playing Katz) but I still wondered if they could pull it off. Redford was not how I imagined Bryson but to his credit he was good and given that almost no-one outside of Iowa knows Katz I had no clue what to expect but both I really enjoyed. There were bits in the film that were not in the book but I guess they had artistic licence and there was a a lot in the book missed in the film but given the length of the book and the time period it was written over this was to be expected.

1123,Opinion: The Addams Family (2019) has the WORST character designs I have ever seen in an animated movie,"I have not seen the actual movie yet, but based on the promos and posters and ads, it it some of the worst I’ve ever seen. The characters look horrendous to where there’s no excuse for them to look that bad. Yes I know they’re supposed to be weird and creepy, but look at Tim Burton’s animated designs: they are deformed and usually undead characters yet they are visually appealing (and in the case of Frankenweenie, down right cute). How the hell did Wednesday “Q Tip Head” Addams get past the design stage? The cold dead eyes of all the characters don’t help anything either.

Edit: I am well aware that’s how they looked in the comics, I just personally think they could have done something different in terms of a 3D character. SpongeBob works great in 2D, but once it goes to 3D, (Sponge Out of Water) it just does not work for me and looks sort of creepy.

1128,Which movie changed the way action scenes are choreographed and filmed?,"I’ve recently been revisiting all the Bond movies and have really been enjoying how action has evolved over the years in film. When jumping from the last Brosnan to the first Craig film, there is a significant change in the way the action is choreographed and filmed. 

Die Another Day came out in 2002 and Casino Royale in 2006. They only films I can think of that may have been the cause for change is The Bourne Identity (2002) and Bourne Supremacy (2004). I think it’s crazy that both Die Another Day and the Bourne Identity came out in the same year when the action sequences are so different from each other, it feels like they came out in different decades. The Bourne fights feel so much more real than those last Brosnan films.

So, what do you all think? What film changed the way action is choreographed and filmed?

Edit: I’ve been receiving a lot of good movie suggestions (many of which I’m going to have to rewatch). I feel like we’re getting closer to an answer. I want to add that I’m looking for movies that changed the tone(?) of action films. Bond movies tend to be late to the party in terms of trends. The Brosnan era has fight scenes that still felt like stage fights whereas the Craig films felt like the characters were out to really hurt each other. Something changed in between those movies and Casino Royale corrected course to make its action feel more real.

1145,What's a movie that was highly praised or hyped that you saw long after release and was let down either due to higher expectations or just thinking the film didn't deserve the initial hype/praise,"I ask this because just a few days ago I watched Inception for the first time. It wasn't a bad movie or anything, I rated it 3.5/5 stars on my letterboxd. But honestly I had such high expectations after years of hype, praise, and cultural impact in media (spawning a lot of references and nods). I'm just a little let down and to me other than the very cool dream layering idea, it just felt like a generic action movie to me. I think I went in expecting something to blow my mind like Shutter Island and was surprised when it was pretty straightforward.

1152,About Time: A glorious disaster for a new father,"Hello reddit,

I know at this point I’m probably screaming into the void. I finally got around to watching this movie. I’d seen roughly what it was about and was interested, but never got around to it. I finally found the time (ironic) to watch it and it borderline broke me. 

If you’ve had a reasonably strong relationship with your father this movie will easily tug at your heart strings. If you are a new father (maybe even a little too angry at the world and what it’s become or what you’ve failed to become) it is particularly poignant. 

I don’t really have much of a point to any of this as I type through blurry and teary eyes, but if you haven’t seen it, I’d give it a go. It doesn’t break ground, but its simplicity is beautiful. And it makes you re-evaluate what you have and what’s worth fighting for. Anyways, I enjoyed it, and I hope you do too. If not that’s also cool. Take care.",movies,"About Time: A glorious disaster for a new father Hello reddit,

Nah it's fine. It's just these people's way of life. Totally cool. Let's stick around. Friends start vanishing after knowing these people are capable of murder? Oh it doesn't really matter. Hell one of the main characters literally says, ""We don't associate as friends of his,"" when his buddy vanishes. Like dude no one is going to give a shit about a thesis when literally two of their friends have gone missing along with another couple. There is no fucking way anyone in their right mind would feel comfortable being an outsider among 20+ pagan people that are fine witnessing and inflicting human loss.

The movie builds such a tense atmosphere but every time a character decision is made I feel the urge to face palm. This is not how real people react to traumatic events. I would argue the only characters that seemed to act competently were the British couple that were murdered. Even then a rational mind would have never bought the whole ""your boyfriend already left without you"" claim and gone off with the cult. This is a red flag. The characters even hear the girl scream and make nothing of it. What was the point?

Then there's the cult. They're shown to be murderers, manipulators, and liars. So my question is why do they keep the farce going for so long? When the final arc begins the only two remaining people are Christian and Dani. The final day begins with the cultists lying about their sacred book to cover up the deaths of Josh and Mark. But why? Literally moments later they start the rituals and murder Christian. What the hell was the point of this? Why not drug the fuckers during breakfast? Why bother if they had the paralyzing agent to begin with?

Again, great atmosphere and acting, but jeez was it disappointing to get the same old incompetent protagonists. Also what the fuck was the point of the guy wearing Mark's skin? Like that was at night and didn't seem to have anything to do with the rituals. Pure shock value? It reminds of a scene from another overall great horror film-- It Follows. In that movie, the creature is said to constantly move towards its target. However there is one weird scene where it just stands on a roof as a naked man. This scene made no sense in the context of the story and felt like a shock value insertion.

Anyway, great atmosphere. Great acting. Bad writing.

So to start things, I'm always itching for a good horror film. Sadly those are so few and far between.

Midsommar was something else. Great visuals. Great atmosphere. Amazing acting. Holy hell at that opening.

But with all that said, my god the character writing was bad. It felt like straight up 70s/80s/90s cheeseball horror. Idiot kids making idiot calls. Witness a suicide and then a straight up murder? Nah it's fine. It's just these people's way of life. Totally cool. Let's stick around. Friends start vanishing after knowing these people are capable of murder? Oh it doesn't really matter. Hell one of the main characters literally says, ""We don't associate as friends of his,"" when his buddy vanishes.

1177,LF horror movies like Midsummer. (Some possible spoilers),"It’s October, no better time for horror movies!

1204,The Addams Family *SNAP* *SNAP* Review (2019),"SPOILERS!

I'm not the biggest fan of this series, I've barley watched the original, so keep that in mind when reading. I did however watch a high-school theater production of it, and I can say it was better than this movie. The Addams Family (2019) is about the Addams family and their day-to-day life, until Wednesday wants to be different from the family, and Pugsley starts to study to become a real ""Addams"" man. 

The story itself is weird. It revolves a lot over real estate, something I wouldn't want in a kid's horror film. It also shows some signs of ""oh everyone's too attached to their phones these days"" through the plot. At one point people attack the Addams with actual torches. 13 years later in the story, their being attacked with torches ... from their phones. They also try to spread gossip through social media, but it doesn't effect the Addams so I didn't see the point in it.

The animation is mediocre overall, nothing stands out. But the characters, OH GEEZ do they suck. Everyone looks horrible, the normal humans more than the ACTUAL monsters. It's mostly because of their noses. Instead of making every character have their own personality and character traits, they made every character have a distinct nose, aaaand it stinks. It really makes their whole face look hideous. Their waists are also weird. Most women have SUPER tight waists, and all the men are fat.

Character traits are also bad. The most outgoing trait was when one character turns emo, and for a moment I thought we went back to 2009. A Little off topic, this same character then exposes the antagonist through the ""ooooo I got u on camera"" cliche. Problem is, she said it was shown to 3 MILLION people, and never before did we see this type of  social media status through the movie.

The writing is dull. The only good written character was Wednesday. The jokes also fall flat, besides for one. At the end Gomez's brother oddly marries the antagonist (it's really weird. First he rides off into the background with her talking about real estate, and the next scene has them married). The joke in question is when he said ""I can't believe me, an absolute 0 got to be with you, also a 0."" That did get me to chuckle.

The beginning was nice and also was the climax and falling action. My favorite part was when they remade the original theme. Which brings me into the next part, the music. It's BAD. Nothing was memorable besides the main theme, and that was only memorable because they didn't change it. They did do a remix at the end, but it's nothing to ride home about.

A good thing about the movie was the moral, it's to stand out from others and be different (I guess they didn't list to their own movie). It's what every other PG animated movie does these days, but I thought it was OK. But that's why my final rating for this movie is a lazy TV sitcom out of 10.

The animation is bad, the music is bad, the story is bad, and the writing is mediocre, but the moral is fine. It also uses nostalgia to get money. If you really wanted to see this, I would wait until it goes on Netfilx/Hulu/YoutubeTV. It's not worth your money. If you could, I would recommend seeing a high-school theater play, or watching the Original. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed this movie more than I did, if you did happen to see it.",movies,"The Addams Family *SNAP* *SNAP* Review (2019) SPOILERS!

I'm not the biggest fan of this series, I've barley watched the original, so keep that in mind when reading. I did however watch a high-school theater production of it, and I can say it was better than this movie. The Addams Family (2019) is about the Addams family and their day-to-day life, until Wednesday wants to be different from the family, and Pugsley starts to study to become a real ""Addams"" man. 

The story itself is weird. It revolves a lot over real estate, something I wouldn't want in a kid's horror film. It also shows some signs of ""oh everyone's too attached to their phones these days"" through the plot. At one point people attack the Addams with actual torches. 13 years later in the story, their being attacked with torches ... from their phones. They also try to spread gossip through social media, but it doesn't effect the Addams so I didn't see the point in it.

The animation is mediocre overall, nothing stands out. But the characters, OH GEEZ do they suck. Everyone looks horrible, the normal humans more than the ACTUAL monsters. It's mostly because of their noses. Instead of making every character have their own personality and character traits, they made every character have a distinct nose, aaaand it stinks. It really makes their whole face look hideous. Their waists are also weird. Most women have SUPER tight waists, and all the men are fat.

Character traits are also bad. The most outgoing trait was when one character turns emo, and for a moment I thought we went back to 2009. A Little off topic, this same character then exposes the antagonist through the ""ooooo I got u on camera"" cliche. Problem is, she said it was shown to 3 MILLION people, and never before did we see this type of  social media status through the movie.

The writing is dull. The only good written character was Wednesday. The jokes also fall flat, besides for one. At the end Gomez's brother oddly marries the antagonist (it's really weird. First he rides off into the background with her talking about real estate, and the next scene has them married). The joke in question is when he said ""I can't believe me, an absolute 0 got to be with you, also a 0."" That did get me to chuckle.

The beginning was nice and also was the climax and falling action. My favorite part was when they remade the original theme. Which brings me into the next part, the music. It's BAD. Nothing was memorable besides the main theme, and that was only memorable because they didn't change it. They did do a remix at the end, but it's nothing to ride home about.

A good thing about the movie was the moral, it's to stand out from others and be different (I guess they didn't list to their own movie). It's what every other PG animated movie does these days, but I thought it was OK. But that's why my final rating for this movie is a lazy TV sitcom out of 10.

I have never been so happy to be a part of a show like I am with this one. Jim Gavin and Peter Ocko have written an absolutely beautiful show. It centers around a group of somewhat down on their luck folks in Long Beach, CA, who have the great good fortune to join a fading mystical fraternal order (a tiny bit like the Masons or Elks Club) called The Order Of The Lynx, specifically Lodge # 49. Their lives begin to change and grow in so many weird and wonderful ways. These characters are SO real, it’s crazy! The best thing is: the show is very funny and very human. It’s real and a little surreal, joyous and sometimes melancholy, down to earth and transcendent. It’s full of Life! And it gives you a real uplifting charge. I love it SO much it’s almost weird. Almost.

anyway, i’m here to answer whatever you got!

1345,Thou Shalt Not Kill (Non Uccidere) Season 3,"**For anyone already familiar with this show...**

Do you know when season 3 is coming to the US? I know it premiered in Italy last December but despite frequent Googling, I haven’t heard any news about when it might be available from US (or UK) distributors. Unfortunately, my Italian is still pretty crap and I’m hopeless unless I have subtitles, so I can’t watch the show without them.

**A little bit about the show for anyone curious...**

[Thou Shalt Not Kill](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5022622/) is an excellent Italian series about a young, highly intuitive detective with a murky past and the challenging and often quite intricate crimes she solves. I realize that sounds fairly standard for a detective show, but I feel this one distinguishes itself in subtle, yet appreciable ways that make it a standout.

For instance, the main character’s insights feel like a wholly earned combination of dogged determination and natural intuition, instead of manifesting as a “sudden epiphany” near the end of every episode. She is guarded, but deeply empathetic in spite of that, which helps a lot with the connections she makes. Also, each investigation unfolds over the course of two episodes, allowing enough attention to be paid to all the characters on both sides of the investigation, as well as red herrings and sub plots. 

The writing is excellent IMO - this is the only procedural detective show where I’ve never once been able to guess the outcome accurately - which I love. Red herrings are always plausible, and even minor actors are nuanced enough to keep you on your toes. The show is also visually striking, with high production values and beautiful Italian scenery.",television,"Thou Shalt Not Kill (Non Uccidere) Season 3 **For anyone already familiar with this show...**

1347,What are your Top 10 favourite live action television series?,"Movies are definitely a great source of entertainment, and while it’s always great to be in the moment when watching a decent movie, it’s a fun ride to watch a television series. Each episode feels like a mini-movie in a long franchise. That’s the joy of watching TV shows. Sometimes they can be weak, sometimes they can be the best thing you’ve watched in a long time. Either way, you’re being entertained non-stop and it feels like there’s a sequel everytime you’re left on a cliffhanger. So here is my list of my Top 10 personal favourite live action television series!

# My Top 10 Favourite Live Action Television Series: 

10.) **DC’s Legends of Tomorrow**

Starting off in my list is DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Me being a sucker for time travel stories, this show is basically a big treat for that. It’s very fun to watch and has a really decent cast to keep me watching. The reason it is very low on my list is because recently, it has really been losing its charm. Only a few moments here and there kept me entertained. Doesn’t change the fact that I will keep watching this show till it’s cancelled or finished. It’s filled with a lot of fun history references and has enough sci-fi action to keep me thrilled. 

9.) **The Flash** 

Easily my favourite series in the Arrowverse. The first and second season are easily the best seasons in this show. After that, this is the reason why this show is also really low on my list. Regardless, it is still a damn good show. Grant Gustin IS the Flash. Nobody could play a better Barry Allen than Grant Gustin. He’s just that perfect. My other only nitpick is Iris. She’s extremely annoying. Other than that, this show has a lot of great villains, such as the Reverse-Flash, Zoom, Trickster, Thinker, Captain Cold, etc. and great supporting characters like Cisco, Caitlyn, Harrison Wells (Choose your pick…), Ralph, etc. It also has a really great theme song. 

8.) **Daredevil**

This series is basically the art of a superhero series. There’s so many things that are shown, which causes you to really think hard about what’s going on. I like those kinds of shows, which don’t always have drama just for the sake of drama, and gives you justified stretched out scenes that tell the story without having to always use dialogue. My personal favourite is with Wilson Fisk. There’s this scene where he looks in the mirror and sees his child self covered in blood. There’s a meaning behind that, and I love how that is enough to say everything without having to say a thing. Aside from that, even the other characters like the main hero, Daredevil, is a really awesome character. We see his evolution into a hero, how he began to feel conflicted in many situations, and how he always stands by his morals. This show also perfectly introduced one of my favourite Marvel superheroes, the Punisher. The action scenes are AMAZING. Then there’s not just the action scenes, but the intense moments. This series just has me at the edge of my seat when during the intense moments, and has me watching carefully at the little things painted in the show. Just… wow. 

7.) **Stranger Things** 

This is a really amazing show that gives a really good nod to eighties films. It’s a series stretched into an eighties story. It’s basically got nearly everything. The teen drama, the supernatural horror, the government conspiracies, the goonies-like adventure kids, etc. The series surprised me on every level when I first watched it and I still adore it to this day. It leaves me with practically every emotion. Sometimes I’d be laughing my ass off, and other times I would be terrified out of my mind. It had great and complex characters, even turning one of my least favourite characters from Season 1 into one of my top favourite characters from Season 3. Nearly everyone had a decent arc. I hope Season 4 will come soon because I’m just not ready for it to end yet. It’s that good.  

6.) **Lost** 

This is probably the best mystery adventure show out there. It’s rather difficult to find a really good series that focuses on mysteries. This is definitely the best at doing that. It starts out as a survival story, where the survivors of a plane crash need to work together to stay alive after finding themselves stranded on an island. Then they realize they’re not alone. That’s when things really get real. It has really menacing villains and pretty well written characters, thanks to the flashbacks which I personally never really had a problem with. In fact, that’s one of the criticisms I disagree with. While I do kind of agree that they got a little too repetative, I still loved them to understand the characters more. There are also clues left all over the series to answer the questions to some of the bigger mysteries in the series. My only nitpick is the ending. Not that it left me hanging, but because it got me down! Also, literally being a story about good vs evil felt way too generic in what it originally was. Regardless, this is still a damn excellent show. My favourite character would have to be Sawyer. He’s just so damn likable. You hate him at first, then you just love his every sarcastic remark and snarky personality.  

5.) **Once Upon a Time** 

As someone who really loves seeing twists on my favourite childhood stories, this show is very good at doing that. I mainly came for this show for Captain Hook, due to him being my favourite Disney Villain, but I ended up staying for Rumplestiltskin because he was just so freaking complex and well written. Like all tv series, it’s going to have weak episodes and seasons, but as a whole, it is still a very decent series. My personal favourite season is the Neverland arc, due to Peter Pan being one of my favourite childhood stories. Seeing Peter Pan as a full blown psychopathic villain was really awesome. The main characters are amazing as well such as Emma, Regina, Snow, David, Henry, Grumpy, Zelena and even Killian to a certain extent. Overall, seeing my favourite fairy tale characters and stories being twisted into a really exciting television series is one of the best things ever. 

4.) **Friends** 

By far my favourite sitcom. It is the funniest show I’ve seen in decades. There are just so many jokes that are very well written, and the main cast are just so damn good. You’d think that a show following a group of friends having everyday lives would be boring, but oh boy, this show is just a fun show. Ross is easily the most hilarious, then there’s Chandler’s one-liners who make the icing on the cake. The drama that happens are definitely good enough, but overall, it’s still a very fun series and I could watch it over and over again. 

3.) **The Walking Dead** 

An awesome apocalypse show based on a zombie apocalypse. Following a group of survivors as they battle their humanity in order to protect one another is one of the sole plot of this series. It shows who the real monsters are, humans or animals. The zombies are merely just eating people because that’s all they do. People killing people because they need to… or they want to. That’s one of the best concepts of this show. Aside from the fact that I am a sucker for apocalypse-themed movies/shows, this series is easily the best at being this. I especially love Negan, the main antagonist in Season 6B to the end of Season 8.  

2.) **Breaking Bad** 

This is the show that felt like it never ended. It started out pretty slow but once things kicked in, it got REALLY good. At first, I thought this show was probably overrated. I gave this movie a hard pass on my first viewing after three episodes, but when my whole family started watching it and enjoying it, I just had to give it one more try and I am glad I did. It is a really intense and dark show, but thanks to Saul Goodman, he was there a few times to lighten the mood. I absolutely love the two main characters, Jesse Pinkman and Walter White, aka Heisenberg. Jesse started out as the jerkass, but eventually became one of most lovable character in the series who you just root for in the end. Then there’s Walt… Oh boy! I just want to say, I love stories which focus on a main protagonist eventually becoming the villain of their own story. Walter White is NO exception. He starts out as a mild-mannered but well-meaning good guy until he eventually transforms into a loathsome villain. The villains were great too, such as the short-lived but unforgettable Tuco and the menacingly sophisticated Gustavo Fring. Mike was also a really awesome character. One minute he’d beat your face in, next he is drinking beer with you. What a guy! I especially loved the movie that came out recently. A perfect closure-ending to a really damn excellent show.  

1.) **Gotham** 

What a ride. What started out as a typical crime drama show ended up becoming what I came to see, a decent prequel series focusing on the characters of Gotham before Batman. What I love are the character developments. Especially Edward Nygma, the Riddler. He starts out as a genuinely nice guy who only wanted to have friends, only to turn into one of the most fearsome villains the city has ever seen. The Penguin is also a really awesome character. He’s sympathetic enough for you to root for him in nearly everything, though I was on the Riddler’s side when he and the Penguin ended up fighting each other. Gordon was a decent protagonist, and following young Bruce and Alfred’s story was really engaging. However, I also loved seeing the nods to the other Batman villains in the series such as the Joker, Mr Freeze, Zsasz, Hugo Strange, Court of Owls, Ra’s Al Ghul, Bane, Scarecrow, Mad Hatter, etc. Great action scenes and great story arcs. Overall, my favourite series ever.

This *isn't* like the Grey's Anatomy/Station 19 crossover.

1359,Primal just wrecked my weekend and I feel so sad now.,"As a big Tartakovsky fan I will watch anything he does so I started watching Primal this week. It reminds me of the Tom and Jerry or Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote shorts they'd play before the main feature in cinemas, all sound and vision but no extended dialogue. The first three episodes I found myself enjoying the somewhat antagonistic relationship between Fang the female dinosaur and Spear the caveman, bonded by the losses of their families to the horned nose dinosaurs. Episode 3 is probably my favourite because of the Mammoths hunt to retrieve their elders tusk to place it at their graveyard with both sides being unrelenting and brutal until then Spear realises what they want, gives it to them and they leave solemnly to do their duty.

However I've just finished the last episode and I was screaming at the TV as Fang did her best to fight off and buy time against the hulked out gorilla that won the Thunderdome contest for the honour of killing Spear and Fang. When he crippled her leg, I was so angry. It was a relief to see Spear free himself and exact revenge but the last 30 seconds where he goes to check on her and she doesn't move at all... I was almost moved to tears by a goddamn dead animated dinosaur being mourned by a cartoon caveman. I know it's all just pretty pictures in sequence but I've not been this upset by a cartoon since Grave of The Fireflies. 

I'm hoping the show gets renewed and somehow Fang can be nursed back to health and isn't actually dead but after she spat up blood and got her leg totally crippled... I feel like this mini series just took my heart, ripped it out and walked over it like a Samoan man in golf cleats before doing a moonwalk back over it for good measure.",television,"Primal just wrecked my weekend and I feel so sad now.

1388,"Red Forman is, by far, my favorite tv dad","Red Forman is constantly acting like a hardass. He calls his son a dumbass constantly, and is always threatening to put his foot in Eric's ass. That's all it is though, an empty threat. He never lays his hand on his children. He works hard and supports his family however he can, whether that means working part time at the plant, taking a side job over the holidays with Bob, or working at the auto parts store. 

For all his tough exterior, he generally supports his son Eric and always wants the best for him. He gives Eric the old Vista Cruiser even though he just went to part time and could've sold it for some extra cash. He prepares an emergency roadside kit when Eric goes to the mountains. On Eric's first date he takes him out to buy a nice new jacket and gives him date money on top of it. When someome chastises Eric in the later seasons, Red responds by saying that his son is a fine young man. He essentially adopts Eric's friend Hyde even though he legitimately cannot afford it. He's a loving husband who dotes on his wife and cares for his children more than he would ever admit.

He calls his son a dumbass constantly, and is always threatening to put his foot in Eric's ass. That's all it is though, an empty threat. He never lays his hand on his children. He works hard and supports his family however he can, whether that means working part time at the plant, taking a side job over the holidays with Bob, or working at the auto parts store. 

For all his tough exterior, he generally supports his son Eric and always wants the best for him. He gives Eric the old Vista Cruiser even though he just went to part time and could've sold it for some extra cash. He prepares an emergency roadside kit when Eric goes to the mountains. On Eric's first date he takes him out to buy a nice new jacket and gives him date money on top of it. When someome chastises Eric in the later seasons, Red responds by saying that his son is a fine young man. He essentially adopts Eric's friend Hyde even though he legitimately cannot afford it. He's a loving husband who dotes on his wife and cares for his children more than he would ever admit. What a great character.",0

1415,Crossing the Rubicon - Phillip Price and Truxton Spangler,"Originally posted to r/MrRobot

Anyone who follows *Mr. Robot*, who also managed to follow AMC's fantastic (although fleeting) series *Rubicon* will instantly recognize the untapped-potential of **Michael Cristofer**'s **Truxton Spangler** finally realized in his titanic role as *Mr. Robot*'s **Phillip Price**. As I'm sure I'm not the first to observe (in fact I know I'm not; [here's an insightful article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/arts/television/rubicon-amc-stream.html) that actually touches on its influence on *Mr. Robot*), *Rubicon* is, in many ways, a direct-precursor to *Mr. Robot*. From a thematic standpoint, both shows deal with the manipulation of truth, the slippery slope of paranoia, and the ways in which the analytical/intellectual powers of deeply-flawed/troubled individuals are misappropriated by the invisible hands that move us all. Even those with the best intentions often find they too are accessories to the ""plots-within-plots"" of unseen one-percenters. (**TL;DR at the end**)

# ""They hide in plain view""

But back to my point. There are two scenes in particular where the dialogue and Michael Cristofer's delivery are *so* similar, I can't help but wonder if it wasn't an intentional callback. Spoilers ahead. Starting with *Mr. Robot* is a scene we're all familiar with, which anyone will remember as the moment it's made clear the magnitude of forces Elliot is up against. And it's Michael Cristofer's delivery in one particular point in the exchange that caught my eye: [here](https://youtu.be/arQ2h-0_4Y4?t=125).

&gt;\[...\] And we **will** ***handle*** **that person... as we** ***usually do***.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Phillip Price, *Mr. Robot* E110, ""eps1.9\_zer0-day.avi""

Which struck me, because it's so, *so* similar to another scene from *Rubicon*. Even within the context of the stories, both scenes parallel one another, featuring an exchange between two of their respective show's most enigmatic figures. On one side, we have an eccentric (if fastidious) executive, whose outward nature bellies a darker menace. On the other, we have something of an unknown quantity, as-of-yet unclear to us if they're an ally or threat to our troubled, paranoid protagonist--whose fate they discuss, naturally, only in the vaguest of terms: [here](https://youtu.be/m7Yxvd3ky3U?t=74).

&gt;If he is, **he will be** ***handled.***.. as ***problems*** ***are***.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Truxton Spangler, *Rubicon* E109, ""No Honesty In Men""

# ""Not every conspiracy is a theory""

I've never posted to this sub before, so perhaps someone has already made this observation, but I thought it was worth sharing in the event nobody had. It would be worth noting the similarities between Michael Cristofer's performances as Truxton Spangler and Phillip Price alone, but the fact that *Mr. Robot* features a line nearly-identical to the above quoted line from *Rubicon* (the lessons from which very well may have made its own existence possible), with the context in which both lines are delivered paralleling one another so closely, makes it difficult *not* to suspect Esmail knew *exactly* what he was doing here. Which, if true, reminds me of [another quote](https://youtu.be/ibI6TopNxGE?t=48):

&gt;Someone either didn't expect the pattern to be caught, **or wasn't afraid if it** ***was***.""

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** *Mr. Robot* and AMC's *Rubicon* both have menacing characters played by Michael Cristofer, who delivers an eerily-similar menacing line in both shows (links above), and I don't think it's a coincidence.

1428,I'm ButtHurt about the ending of Penny Dreadful,"Binged the entire show over the last week and I admit I probably wasn't paying enough attention to get all of the nuances of the story lines but gosh golly do I love these characters. I wanted so badly to walk away from the show uplifted and satisfied but I'm really really sour about the entire third season and I need to put some thoughts down about my fav characters that got did dirty: 

Hecate - just fuckin shot bro built up for an entire season as devious and ambitious and formidable and BANG all u did was dry out, fuck a werewolf, and summon six snakes that didn't even kill everyone they were supposed to??? I HAD DREAMS FOR THIS BITCH I LOVED THIS BITCH 

Cat 'definitely not a mary sue' Death Doctor - ""who are you?"" ""i believe i'm the woman that just saved your life"" like bro you're in his house just answer the question this exchange got to me so hard like i could feel the writer being like 'yeahhhhh yeaaaH that's how you write a strong female character - just make her ....... rude.' and then the full minute of her arguing with sir malcolm about his neck because he didn't want to listen to a woman???? I'm assuming that they were expecting a fourth season and she was going to play a greater part of it in the long term but try to pitch 'Super Hot, Incredibly Dangerous with Swords, Immune to being Afraid, Very Young and a genius beautiful sexy Expert In Her Field, and just Puts Men In Their Place For No Reason' to a room full of women and see how far that gets 

Lily - I cried watching this show two times, both during the third season, and both during scenes where women were being held against their will. 

I was promised a coup of women transforming the streets of Victorian London with an immortal fury. Instead I got fuck face Dorian selling out his only companion for being an ambitious and furious woman to fuck face Victor who literally wants to 'cure' her? and I mean the clear parallels between her situation with victor and the episode about Vanessa's time in the hospital and the concept of 'fixing' someone. I cried when Lily realized that she had been betrayed and that she was about to be chemically lobotomized by someone who wanted to FUCK HER INCAPACITATED BODY FOR THE REST OF HER IMMORTAL LIFE. I was horrified! I can't imagine anything worse in the entire world! I bawled! I thought, surely, this woman is going to get the furious revenge that her character has been built upon. 

JK she has to tell victor a traumatizing story to make him reconsider her as an actual human being and after he lets her go she just....... dips. And says some mean words to Dorian after he murdered Justine - Lily's 'soul puppet' - and, I cannot stress this enough, TRAFFICKED HER FOR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND SEXUAL ASSAULT

and she's just like 'wow ur like super boring and hurtful i'm gonna go' 

????????????

????!?!??!??!!!!!!?!??!?!?!?!!!

I'm furious

Justine - murdered. A energizing presence in the story, the conflict that she sparked between Lily and Dorian was incredible and made me think that Dorian was about to do one interesting fucking thing in the grand scheme of this entire show but nope just more boring impassive expressions as commits the most boring murders in the entire show

Vanessa - I don't even want to get into it

the lord's prayer scene was weak 

this season was weak 

I'm so steamed I feel betrayed by this creative team and underwhelmed by the third season and reading the majorly positive reviews makes me feel like a crazy person! Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk",television,"I'm ButtHurt about the ending of Penny Dreadful Binged the entire show over the last week and I admit I probably wasn't paying enough attention to get all of the nuances of the story lines but gosh golly do I love these characters. I wanted so badly to walk away from the show uplifted and satisfied but I'm really really sour about the entire third season and I need to put some thoughts down about my fav characters that got did dirty: 

Hecate - just fuckin shot bro built up for an entire season as devious and ambitious and formidable and BANG all u did was dry out, fuck a werewolf, and summon six snakes that didn't even kill everyone they were supposed to??? I HAD DREAMS FOR THIS BITCH I LOVED THIS BITCH 

Cat 'definitely not a mary sue' Death Doctor - ""who are you?"" ""i believe i'm the woman that just saved your life"" like bro you're in his house just answer the question this exchange got to me so hard like i could feel the writer being like 'yeahhhhh yeaaaH that's how you write a strong female character - just make her ....... rude.' and then the full minute of her arguing with sir malcolm about his neck because he didn't want to listen to a woman???? I'm assuming that they were expecting a fourth season and she was going to play a greater part of it in the long term but try to pitch 'Super Hot, Incredibly Dangerous with Swords, Immune to being Afraid, Very Young and a genius beautiful sexy Expert In Her Field, and just Puts Men In Their Place For No Reason' to a room full of women and see how far that gets 

Lily - I cried watching this show two times, both during the third season, and both during scenes where women were being held against their will. 

I was promised a coup of women transforming the streets of Victorian London with an immortal fury. Instead I got fuck face Dorian selling out his only companion for being an ambitious and furious woman to fuck face Victor who literally wants to 'cure' her? and I mean the clear parallels between her situation with victor and the episode about Vanessa's time in the hospital and the concept of 'fixing' someone. I cried when Lily realized that she had been betrayed and that she was about to be chemically lobotomized by someone who wanted to FUCK HER INCAPACITATED BODY FOR THE REST OF HER IMMORTAL LIFE. I was horrified! I can't imagine anything worse in the entire world! I bawled! I thought, surely, this woman is going to get the furious revenge that her character has been built upon. 

JK she has to tell victor a traumatizing story to make him reconsider her as an actual human being and after he lets her go she just....... dips. And says some mean words to Dorian after he murdered Justine - Lily's 'soul puppet' - and, I cannot stress this enough, TRAFFICKED HER FOR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND SEXUAL ASSAULT

and she's just like 'wow ur like super boring and hurtful i'm gonna go' 

????????????

????!?!??!??!!!!!!?!??!?!?!?!!!

I'm furious

Justine - murdered. A energizing presence in the story, the conflict that she sparked between Lily and Dorian was incredible and made me think that Dorian was about to do one interesting fucking thing in the grand scheme of this entire show but nope just more boring impassive expressions as commits the most boring murders in the entire show

Vanessa - I don't even want to get into it

1441,"Vexed (2010) - the forgotten cop comedy show that deserves to grow a cult following, starring Toby Stephens and Lucy Punch and written by Creator of Misfits and Future Man Howard Overman","Vexed is so darkly funny and peculiar. 

I actually think this is a better show than Misfits!

Howard Overman created this a year later than Misfits season one, 2010, it got a second season but it remains quietly forgotten. Unlike Misfits, that skyrocketed in fame.

However, the stars of the show are now huge actors, Toby Stephens (Lost on Space, Black Sails), son of Maggie Smith, and Lucy Punch (A Series of Unfortunate Event, Motherland). As you'd expect, their central performances are incredible.

It centres around two cops in London and their cases in each episode. It feels like an irreverent sitcom. Stephens' character is totally unprofessional and self serving, it's hilarious. Punch's character is generally quite exasperated at his actions. They have a very funny dynamic.

An extract from Wikipedia that describes it well:

The Guardian's Sam Wollaston also liked it, saying ""It's cheeky, irreverent, puerile, sometimes inappropriate. It also made me laugh, almost out loud a few times, and that's no bad thing in a comedy"" and again praised Stephens's ""fabulous"" acting, while Punch's performance was ""excellent"".[7] He asserted: ""Toby Stephens is fabulous as übertwerp Jack. He has a nice, pleased-as-punch-with-himself complacency, changing his voice and raising an eyebrow when he talks to ladies. There's a hint of self-doubt there, but not enough to stop him being a total cock. And Lucy Punch as Kate is excellent at being appalled by him, but also just a tiny bit impressed, even attracted to him. Together they're wonderfully awful.""


Anyway, this show was on the BBC and is currently is on the UK Netflix. It went for two series.

I have only just started watching it. I am surprised this never gained more popularity or atleast a cult following. CAS in point: This is the first post on this subreddit about Vexed. I couldn't find any others. 

It's a forgotten gem.

Has anyone else seen this? What do you think of the show?

Although - I have seen on wiki that Howard Overman and Lucy Punch were no longer involved in the show in its second series. Does anyone know why?

We could see more of Amber Atkins working at the funeral home part-time, the Leeman's messed up home life, Annette and Loretta's shenanigans, the Amy Adams and Brittany Murphy characters could be supporting characters who play friends of Amber. The show could also focus on the class divide between Annette, Loretta, and Amber and the Leemans in small town Minnesota.

But then there’s also the crying breakdown in front of Todd in the desert.

And all the comedy too.

He juggles so many tones and not a single line seems off.

1529,"The Leftovers s03e04 is one of the best episodes of television to ever air, but not just because of the fight between Kevin and Nora [spoiler alert]","Another user posted a video of the dramatic fight between Kevin and Nora, and there's no argument as to the intensity of that moment.  However, there's a nuance that those who don't have schizophrenia may miss.  It was so well done, though! If you want to get an idea of what it is like living with schizophrenia, just look at how the show perfectly set up a delusion.

Kevin sees Evie outside of G'day Melbourne and hops in a cab to go find her.  When he finally has her cornered he launches in to a paranoid interrogation, and Evie is visibly upset.  Fortunately, Kevin sent a pic of Evie to Laurie as proof that she's alive, and it's that pic that Laurie has him look at that brings Kevin out of his delusion.

That scene was just so beautifully set up.  Kevin and Nora know their relationship is ending, and that stress is really starting to eat at his mind.  The sex in the bathroom at the airport - that sexual lashing out is a coping mechanism some schizophrenics use to exercise control over something in their lives.  That stress leads Kevin's mind to see things that aren't there or see them differently than they are, and that's when Kevin sees Evie.

The thing about a delusion is that it doesn't affect just the life of the person having the delusion; it affects the lives of anyone that delusion is projected towards.  In this case, Kevin's delusion scared the daylights out of a random Muslim woman who was there to hold a sign up for G'day Melbourne.  He held her against her will and interrogated her because he thought she was someone else.

But the tragedy of it all is that Laurie, his first wife, is the only one with the grip on his heart to pull him out of the delusion.  Without her, Kevin could slip in to his mind and never come back. That's just one reason why the stakes are so high in their fight later in the episode.

1532,"With the recent trend of fantasy adventure books being adapted into big budget shows due to the success of GoT, is there any upcoming sci fi books/series being adapted as well (like the Hyperion Cantos)?","[Sorry had to repost due to vague title post before]

Do you think Netflix, HBO, Amazon would ever pick up a show on this book series? Adapting the book(s) would probably be more difficult for a movie. 

I could see the first book’s Canterbury Tales style chapter structure being broken down into an hour-long episode for each of the main characters backstory. And then maybe an episode at the beginning for an intro episode. And then one or two episodes for the final chapter when all the characters are together. Could be similar to Lost structure where each episode starts with present day and then has flashbacks to the past for one character per episode (obviously in the book the characters literally sit down and tell their past stories/connection). And then the subsequent books don’t really need the full-episode flashback sequences. 

Some potential issues for networks/studios I could see arise:

1.	Budget necessary for this scale of show. Would be hard to make set pieces for all the different worlds. But over use of green screen would probably look like shit. 
2.	Only 4 books. Might not be long enough for a big network investment. 
3.	The big time jump from the first two books to the last two books. Would require new characters for audience to get attached to.
4.	The structure of the first book. The necessary in-depth backstories might make the first few episodes feel a bit disjointed. It would probably feel more like a mini-series then a traditional tv show. 

Some potential positives networks might see though:

1.	Great story that kind of fits between pure sci fi genre and pure fantasy adventure genre.
2.	Amazing amazing world building (GoT showed people love a world/series with a rich backstory that could be explored).
3.	The Shrike provides that intriguing villain that looms over the whole show with a mysterious unknown background. Where does it come from, who created it, why did they create it, what are the full extent of its powers. Kind of similar to the White Walkers before Benioff shit the bed (sorry about all the GoT comparisons). 
4.	Solid ‘twist/surprise’ with the Consul. 
3.	The show ‘The Terror’ on AMC was successfully adapted from another book of the author of Hyperion, Dan Simmons.
4.	Bradley Cooper once wanted to adapt it into a movie 5 years ago or so (and then I guess teamed with Syfy to adapt it for TV?) before going into creative/development hell. 

I thought initially it wouldn’t translate well to film/TV or might be too expensive. But Altered Carbon looked pretty solid given the scale and all the CGI (regardless of how good you thought that shows story was). I feel like a movie would be extremely difficult to flesh out 5 (or was it 6?) full ‘unrelated/distinct’ backstories and tie it all together for the relatively anticlimactic first book ending in 2 hours. 

Game of thrones opened the door for all these new big budget fantasy/adventure shows coming out soon - lord of the rings, the Witcher, wheel of time, his dark materials. There doesn’t seem to be as much of an audience for big budget sci fi shows though. Star Trek and the Expanse are good and have decent sized budgets. Altered Carbon and Lost in Space kind of disappointed in story but delivered in cinematography/budget.

Could be similar to Lost structure where each episode starts with present day and then has flashbacks to the past for one character per episode (obviously in the book the characters literally sit down and tell their past stories/connection). And then the subsequent books don’t really need the full-episode flashback sequences. 

Some potential issues for networks/studios I could see arise:

1.	Budget necessary for this scale of show. Would be hard to make set pieces for all the different worlds. But over use of green screen would probably look like shit. 
2.	Only 4 books. Might not be long enough for a big network investment. 
3.	The big time jump from the first two books to the last two books. Would require new characters for audience to get attached to.
4.	The structure of the first book. The necessary in-depth backstories might make the first few episodes feel a bit disjointed. It would probably feel more like a mini-series then a traditional tv show. 

Some potential positives networks might see though:

1.	Great story that kind of fits between pure sci fi genre and pure fantasy adventure genre.
2.	Amazing amazing world building (GoT showed people love a world/series with a rich backstory that could be explored).
3.	The Shrike provides that intriguing villain that looms over the whole show with a mysterious unknown background. Where does it come from, who created it, why did they create it, what are the full extent of its powers. Kind of similar to the White Walkers before Benioff shit the bed (sorry about all the GoT comparisons). 
4.	Solid ‘twist/surprise’ with the Consul. 
3.	The show ‘The Terror’ on AMC was successfully adapted from another book of the author of Hyperion, Dan Simmons.
4.	Bradley Cooper once wanted to adapt it into a movie 5 years ago or so (and then I guess teamed with Syfy to adapt it for TV?) before going into creative/development hell. 

I thought initially it wouldn’t translate well to film/TV or might be too expensive. But Altered Carbon looked pretty solid given the scale and all the CGI (regardless of how good you thought that shows story was). I feel like a movie would be extremely difficult to flesh out 5 (or was it 6?) full ‘unrelated/distinct’ backstories and tie it all together for the relatively anticlimactic first book ending in 2 hours. 

Game of thrones opened the door for all these new big budget fantasy/adventure shows coming out soon - lord of the rings, the Witcher, wheel of time, his dark materials. There doesn’t seem to be as much of an audience for big budget sci fi shows though. Star Trek and the Expanse are good and have decent sized budgets. Altered Carbon and Lost in Space kind of disappointed in story but delivered in cinematography/budget. I haven’t seen older sci fi shows like Stargate.",0

1550,Hosting a watch party with 10 of my furthest strangers.

Basically I would invite 10 or so people over to my house, charge like $15 bucks, order a bunch of food, buy some liquor, and we watch the premiere together.

1576,9-1-1 is the most entertaining pile of garbage I’ve even seen,"I just need to rant for a moment about this beautiful piece of shit. 9-1-1 is currently on its third season at Fox. Being a Ryan Murphy production, I’m assuming a lot of reddit users never gave it a chance. Allow me to persuade you.

The show follows a crime or accident from three different perspectives: the firefighters, the police, and the 9-1-1 operators. We see each group follow multiple events each episode. Said events are “ripped from the headlines” meaning they have all technically happened. Since they need to keep topping the last episode, the accidents get crazier and crazier. 

Some of the accidents include: 

A plane crashing into the ocean

A shark eats a man on a freeway

A bath salts zombie

A man gets rebar stuck through his skull (and lives)

A fucking tsunami hits California with no warning 

A bouncy house blows off of a mountain with children inside 

A rollercoaster malfunctions leaving people hanging upside down

Now here’s why this is amazing: all of these are dealt with by the **same crew every time**. And they approach each incident with a “business as usual” attitude that is just brilliant. All of these near-impossible disasters take place within days of each other and the absurdity is barely acknowledged. 

This is all sandwiched between the most contrived and hilarious personal drama you’ve ever seen. In the first scene in which we are introduced to Angela Bassett’s family, the father comes out as gay to his children. This is played as a big emotional moment for the characters that we *just met thirty seconds ago.* This leads to the daughter getting bullied and attempting suicide in the next episode. The mother, Angela Bassett, then *arrests the bully under false pretenses.*. THIS ALL HAPPENS SO FAST AND ITS BARELY MENTIONED AFTER THE FACT.

Don’t even get me started on Jennifer Love Hewitt. She replaces Connie Britton as the main 9-1-1 operator in the second season, because apparently Connie can only work with Ryan Murphy ten episodes at a time. Hewitt plays Maddie, who bursts into tears during every single fucking one of her calls. Like, I feel like an operator should have some semblance of control over their emotions, but not Maddie. She lets them tears flow freely pretty much every episode. And she talks about quitting every five minutes, and I’m yelling at the screen like “Yes! Quit! You clearly can’t do this!”  But you just know she’s not gonna fucking quit.

But my last, and most important point, is the budget. Because while the show I’ve described is cheesy as hell, it’s one of the most technically impressive shows I’ve even seen. Like the effects are genuinely good and it’s obvious that a lot of effort has been put into making the show look great. Plus, you have Angela Bassett there to chew the fuck out of the scenery.

That’s all I have to say. If anyone actually reads this shit I really can’t recommend the show enough.

1639,The most compelling moments in television history.,"I would like to start a discussion on the most compelling, moving, impactful moments in all of television. I tried to find clips of these scenes, but some were unavailable, so I have just listed the episode number instead. I will keep it limited to one scene per show. Feel free to add your own to the list. 

**The Sopranos.** 

S06E14 “Stage 5” – Evidently Chickentown. 

There were so many scenes to choose from the Sopranos I found it difficult to keep myself to one. However, this scene which appeared at the very end of an episode, left me with a profound feeling of unease and dread. While this moment in terms of plot was relatively unimportant, the way it foreshadowed the chaos and bloodshed which would occur in future episodes was deeply unsettling. Somehow this song was able to demonstrate the total breakdown of Tony and Chris’s relationship even though no words were exchanged. A truly dark and ominous scene, I have no idea how this song worked so well. 

**The Wire.**

S03E11 “Middle Ground” – The Death of Stringer Bell.

The confrontation between Omar and Stringer marked the climax and pinnacle of The Wire in my opinion. The show did a brilliant job of depicting Stringers increased involvement and interest in the financial world. His economic classes, his adoption of corporate strategies in organised crime and his actions towards legitimizing himself. All of this culminating in the realisation for the viewer that he was in over his head, as smart as Stringer was, the wealthy people of Baltimore were always going figure out a way to separate a drug dealer from his money. Stringers death symbolizes the impossibility of escaping a life of crime and poverty. 

**Hannibal.** 

S02E12 “Mizumono” – Hannibal kills Abigail. 

This entire episode belongs on this list in my opinion; however, this scene was probably a 12/10 in an episode where not a moment was below 10/10. This scene provides the audience with a rare insight into the mind of a brilliant, complex and very disturbed individual. Hannibal had kept Abigail all this time as a surprise for Will, evidence that the teacup could regather itself and complete their family. However, Will’s betrayal was obviously deeply hurtful to Hannibal and Abigail had to die. Outstanding acting in this episode by Mads Mikkelsen as usual. 

**Mad Men** 

S06E13 “In Care Of” – Don's façade shatters during Hershey pitch. 

One of the main themes of Mad Men was the idea that Don Draper is a façade (or person suit in Hannibal) used by Dick Whitman to hide from his past. In this scene Don’s assured and confident persona breaks down. He begins to share intimate details regarding his childhood when in an environment where professionalism is required. It greatly illuminates the extent to which Don Draper, despite his successes, is a very unhappy and despairing individual. 

**Twin Peaks** 

S02E14 “Lonely Souls” – Melancholy at the Roadhouse. 

This is the episode where Laura Palmers killer is finally revealed to the audience. The brutal murder of Madeline Palmer is only the second most unsettling part of this episode. Simultaneous to her murder, the inhabitants of Twin peaks are all at The Roadhouse. Every character there knows something truly terrible is happening, yet nobody knows what. As Agent Cooper is told by the giant in a vision it is happening again, Donna begins to sob and Bobby is overcome by sadness. A poignant and disturbing moment in a show also famous for its quirkiness and humour. 

**Honourable mentions:** 

**Breaking Bad** S05E14 “Ozymandias” – Hanks death. 

**GOT** S01E10 “Fire and Blood” – Daenerys hatches her dragons. 

**Big Little Lies** S01E06 “You Get What You Need” – Perry’s true nature is revealed. 

**Mindhunter** S01E10 “Lone Wolf” – Holden’s Panic Attack. 

**Succession** S01E06 “Which Side Are You On” – The vote of no confidence. 

**The Americans** S05E13 “The Soviet Division” – Paige doesn’t get on the train. 

**Bates Motel** S04E10 “Norman” – Norma is dead. 

**Freaks and Geeks** E18 “Discos and Dragons”- Lindsey gets on the bus.

1640,Fleabag and Killing Eve is more about brilliant performance by the protagonist than story,"So both the shows are quite popular now and have won lot of praise for performance and story.

I think PWB and Jodie Comer are the reason why the show works well with audience but otherwise are quite average show.

Fleabag attempts to generate sympathy for the lead stating that she was hit by a recent tragedy, but in show that is hardly important. Irrespective of that She is a horrible person.Show posters and its promotion tells how her mother death has affected her and how she deals with it.But her character in show doesn't need that background as I don't see that having any effect on the character.

Most unrealistic part of Killing Eve apart from the fact that everything is super easy for Villanelle, is that she is supposed to fall in love with Eve, a dull and boring person.

And to believe that Sandra Oh won Golden globes for that.

Anyway, I'm about to watch the final episode of Fleabag and I've absolutely loved the series and I'm trying to figure out where it ranks for me all-time.",0

I thought I'd start off with one of the most frequent complaints, and also one of the most ridiculous. Like, it's mind-blogging to me why anyone could even think this, or even care. Are they so uncomfortable with seeing gays, trans etc. in TV shows? And I must clarify, even though I do see posts and comments like that on this subreddit sometimes, it's not just here, it's twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms. I see comments like ""Why are there so many gays on TV lately?"" ""Damn, even -*insert title here*\-'s gay now"" way too often. No, it's not true, LGBT+ groups aren't being over-represented on TV. Yes, they are present more than they were *let's say* 5 years ago. Sure some shows are more LGBT+ friendly than others, but what do you mean by ""over-represented"" exactly? Do you think show-creators should go ""Oh, only 10% of the worlds population is gay, so only 10% of characters in my show should be gay""?? People are gay, get over it.

**Complaint #2: ""Too many sex scenes in TV shows""**

I've been seeing complaints like this for a while now, but I don't understand why it bothers people so much. In most cases it's just another scene, what's the difference? Do they ever complain about car chase scenes, shoot-out scenes, training montages etc. Though, I do admit, most sex scenes are wack, especially non TV-MA ones where they don't have uncensored freedom, but I can't say it has ever bother me to the point where I have to come online to complain about it. But I think there's a factor these complainers are missing. In the more explicit cases, sex is usually there for world-building, style or erotica whether artsy or plain.

**Complaint #3: ""Netflix originals aren't good. They're mostly teen-oriented""**

""Teen shows = bad"", I feels like I've been seeing this for years, never understood the hate for the genre. Sure there are some bad teen shows out there but there are also some great ones, just as there are great crime-dramas and bad ones, or any other genre as a matter a fact. Now a don't know the reason behind Netflix targeting young adults, but if you're telling me there isn't at least 3 Netflix originals that you like, you're not watching Netflix originals. And I'd be curious to know what these people like exactly. Netflix has had a quite stellar lineup of original so far, the only network I can think of that's better is HBO.

**Complaint #4: ""Friends and The Office leaving Netflix""**

Now Friends and The Office are 2 of the most watched shows on Netflix, and there's an uproar every time there's a threat/rumor of them leaving. Honestly, what can I say, there was no promise that Netflix would keep these or any other licensed show forever. If they're you favorites, you should probably buy the Blu-ray or get it digitally and save it to a hard-drive or something.

**Complaint #5: ""Netflix cancelling TV shows""**

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about when people get upset about their favorite shows being cancelled, I'm talking about people who seem to have convinced themselves Netflix shouldn't cancel TV shows at all. It's a TV network people, just like HBO, Amazon Prime, FX etc. If a shows viewership isn't up to standard, why should they keep spending money to make it??

**Complaint #6: ""Characters making dumb decisions""**

Now this one is probably the most justifiable on the list because TV characters really do be making dumb decisions, and sometimes it is due to bad bad writing, but too many times I've seen people complaining about characters making dumb decisions when it is the fueling factor for drama and excitement in the show. Think of it this way, art imitates life, and people make dumb decisions as much or even more than TV characters. If you were in a similar situation as that character what decision would you have made? If all TV characters go around making good decisions all the time, well that would be no fun would it. You think you want that, but you don't.   

**Complaint #7: ""Trash like \_\_\_\_\_\_ are still on while my favorite shows are criminally underrated""**

In my opinion calling something that millions of people are consistently watching 'trash' is never justifiable. And this applies to ""Why was this cancelled?"" and ""Why are they still making this?"" complaints as well. Not seeming to understand that one's own taste and that of one's small circle of acquaintances just might not extrapolate to the world in general seems to be the main issue here.

1677,Rewatching The Big Bang Theory and NOT impressed.,"begins rant/

So my MO when I'm feeling low is to watch things that remind me of the days when I was happy. And TBBT definitely succeeded in that I'm not feeling low anymore. I'm mad.

The problem starts with Penny, 22(when the show begins), barely educated by most of all condescending. I'm my mind she represents a typical Midwestern American - superiority complex, lives in a bubble, disrespects other cultures, entitled because she's good looking and almost as bad as Sheldon's mother. Just because the guys are different from her ""idea"" of what's normal and socially ""accepted"" she feels she's better than them somehow. It blame the American education system of course. The rampant bullying, prizing brawn over brain, violent solutions to mundane problems and a general entitlement of people who have insecurities. Penny is all of these. She doesn't really feel bad about bullying people, she's just embarrassed because Bernie and Amy judge her. She was doing it because ""they"" were looking down at ""her"" and she always needs the be in the right. 

The blatant lack of acknowledgement of Sheldon's condition, is another thing. Sheldon clearly had OCD and lies on the autism spectrum. Instead of understanding his problems the circle just exploits his quirks. Even when he does nothing but help people to the best of his abilities like lending Penny money, helping the guys get onto projects, helping Raj, supporting Howard when he fucks up, he's always there for his friends but they just use him as fodder for their needs. Especially of course, Penny. Yes he's obnoxious but he isn't mean spirited which miss no-last-name absolutely is. 

This is more of an anti penny rant because honestly she treats her friends like shit. And k can't believe American Media airs stuff like this. It's so extremely full of racism, classism and endorses stereotypes which is fun in a satirical wag to an intellectual audience but considering where it's aired the audience is not that. Maybe about 25% will not take everything shown literally. It's sad. I used to live this show up until a couple of years back and now it's just blah.

1686,Eureka is an amazing show,"I watched Eureka when it first aired, and remember it being fun but otherwise a standard cheesy and forgettable Syfy show. I recently found it again when scrolling through Prime Video and decided to rewatch, and was completely blown away this time around.

The premise is simple — “sheriff of a town full of geniuses prevents runaway experiments from destroying the town or worse”. The science stuff is definitely cheesy and lighthearted, and that works to the show’s advantage. The monster of the week theme does get a bit repetitive and tiresome at times, but the overall arcs and fun characters still keep you going. I would describe the show as a non-serious Fringe which still manages to deal with heavy topics like science &amp; technology, morality, AI, time travel, alternate timelines and more.

The defining feature of the show to me is its amazing set of characters. I can’t think of any other show that has this big of a primary, secondary and tertiary cast and yet makes you genuinely care about each one of them. Every character has a rich backstory and develops beautifully and sensibly through the series’ run. The all have amazing chemistry and seem to be having a blast on set.

Something else I noticed during the rewatch is how clever and layered the writing is. Characters regularly reference tiny plot points that happened seasons ago. Interactions with experiments and very minor characters sometimes have consequences way down the line. The show completely switches timelines three times during its run and somehow pulls off each one of them. It manages to effortlessly switch from being hilariously funny to very serious to tearjerker, sometimes within the span of a single episode.

If you are looking for something new and fun to watch definitely give Eureka a try.",television,"Eureka is an amazing show I watched Eureka when it first aired, and remember it being fun but otherwise a standard cheesy and forgettable Syfy show.

I can’t think of any other show that has this big of a primary, secondary and tertiary cast and yet makes you genuinely care about each one of them. Every character has a rich backstory and develops beautifully and sensibly through the series’ run. The all have amazing chemistry and seem to be having a blast on set.

Something else I noticed during the rewatch is how clever and layered the writing is. Characters regularly reference tiny plot points that happened seasons ago. Interactions with experiments and very minor characters sometimes have consequences way down the line. The show completely switches timelines three times during its run and somehow pulls off each one of them. It manages to effortlessly switch from being hilariously funny to very serious to tearjerker, sometimes within the span of a single episode.

If you are looking for something new and fun to watch definitely give Eureka a try.",0
1687,Better Than Us is worst for Russia (spoilers),"Help me like this series. 

Are Russian film artists so hyper-aware of the lack of innovation in Russia that the entire premise has to be based on Chinese innovation?

The driven investigator doesn't act driven. 

The translations are awkward at times. The subtitles make more sense, and the voice acting is not that great.

The Chinese bot that is the subject presents several problems. Full capabilities are never used.

They never change the face of the bot from the original design. 

The extreme advertisements with the original face never prompted Chinese action, which doesn't make sense, because they knew it was a black market murder bot.

None of the characters are really written as though they are intelligent, and few of their motivations have enough exposition or foundation. 

It's like reading a slow novel where the characters are boring, lack real motivation, and nobody thinks to share vital information when there is clear motivation to do so.

I need more information about the Russian criminal justice system. Since when are people not detained when clear evidence exists without, at the very least, significant bribery. 

Last minute insertion of cannon fodder characters to add mayhem/drama without any real need.

Since when do you arrange to escape trial, jail, and possible death, to a tropical non-extradition country ... a week form now, and not now.

I have no idea who these actors are in the intro, because they are all in Russian only.

Why didn't they let full AI become more apparent progressively, and do some exciting things with that, especially since there was so much dead space to fill.

So many continuity and technical errors. 

Those are enough issues to get started.",television,"Better Than Us is worst for Russia (spoilers) Help me like this series.

1691,[Spoilers] How I met your Mother is kind of over-hated?,"Okay its an old series but I rewatched it because I really did not understand all the hate past S4-S5. I first binge watched HIMYM back in 2015 on my friend's recommendation. Im not saying people are not allowed to dislike this series but really was it that bad that it was unwatchable? 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Most of my friends who didnt like HIMYM complained about how ridiculous fantasy like the stories were past S4. Well the thing with that is whenever there is a movie/series about a character telling a story of their past I just inherently assume they are going to tell it like it is a hyperbole. Hell Barney's stories in Ted's recollection were the biggest exaggerations and I for one really enjoyed those stories. Like his story about the sexless inn-keeper and the hundred others. One ridiculous story was Robin being thrown into the wild to live 3 days in survival mode. But even then it was just for explaining the issues she had with her father. I feel this going-back-to-the-past to tell a story is a very smart tool for writers because it gives them this extra freedom to be a little ""ridiculous"". Even personally when me and my friends are feeling a little nostalgic we have that moment where we tell a funny story and laugh hysterically while people keep adding things to make it even funnier are the best stories and it goes without saying it gets a little ridiculous. 
2. One thing I do agree on is the way they decided to space out the whole thing. I do not remember the exact seasons but I did feel that a couple seasons were a little dragged. But I really did enjoy most seasons. I'd even say the ending might have been a little abrupt. They could have explained a little more on why Barney and Robin started arguing. The whole Robin got too busy thing was forced but still believable. The first time they broke up they had like an entire episode on what had happened to them and stuff. The biggest wtf was when they killed off Tracy in a matter of seconds. On the same point, my friends also said that they did a very sloppy job on showing how Tracy was perfect for Ted. Which I kinda agree on, they just mentioned like a couple things like that chain mail armor thing and her being in a band and stuff.  And what I am going to say next to justify why that might have been okay might seem  little outlandish but hear me out - it was never Tracy's story. I will get back to this. 
3. Barney/Marshal/Lily involvement with their arcs. This was never really an issue but this is one reason why we felt it was a little dragged out. I did not mind these arcs personally. But we did agree that some things could have been done differently like Marshal should not have gotten so much story time with his career. It was like way too dragged out imo. Lily's dad also felt unnecessary how much screen time that whole thing with father issues got. Again, I did not mind those arcs while watching them but in the grand scheme of things it really does beg the question if it was necessary at all. Well Idk about Marshal/Lily but for all arcs related to Barney and Robin they really did matter because it all added to how they got married. This is a story of Ted and Robin. 

(There were other reasons too which i dont wanna mention because this post is too long as is. But in a gist just Ted  being ridiculous and frustrating as a character and what not.) In the end it all comes down Ted and Robin. Even the kids at the end say this was never about Tracy. This story was about if they were okay with him getting together with Robin. Coming back to my reason number 2. This was never Tracy's story. Ted was telling this story because he wanted to be with Robin. In the story he always said its always been Robin and Marshal always said ""not yet"" to Lily about his bet. When I first watched S1 I knew this story was going to be about Robin. She was a main character and the way she was introduced was almost a dead giveaway. But then the whole thing panned out and the stories were told; Barney marries Robin and for a second I thought okay maybe this is not really about Robin. But then right when it is ending it goes back to the blue french horn and then it hit me. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ROBIN. I asked myself would I have enjoyed the story if it was not Robin at the end and honestly I would have been disappointed if it was not.  This whole story was meant to be told in a matter of 30 minutes. That's why the kids are always in the same clothes. Same place. Same age. Ted is the kind of character to go his whole life just to find ""the one"" to fulfill his destiny and all that jazz. He was always like that with his idea of a perfect first date and how he went back to Robin's place. The writers probably had this vision right from the beginning.

The finale was a jarring shift in tone and mood, and ultimately this feel-good ending felt forced, needlessly melodramatic, and poorly written.

We have 9+ hours of this house being an embodiment of evil. The house makes mothers kill their children thinking they're protecting them, it manipulates you into suicide, it destroys families, it ruins lives...

But wait, it's actually full of love and happiness and a place for the dead to reunite and spend eternity together. ""Those who walk there, walk together."" What????

The ending monologue was so ridiculous that I felt we were going to get to a reveal that the last half hour or so was a dream. Like, this well-written show can't really be losing its edge this close to the end, right? What happened to the subtlety that this show was a master at?

The happily-ever-after ending felt hollow. It felt emotionally-manipulative. It didn't feel earned, and it certainly didn't feel like anything remotely close to horror.

1718,best shows i have watched (OPINION),"Watched not too many shows in total (61). I need to watch more but here are my 15 favorites of those 61 and my thoughts and rating out of ten for each show:

1. **Breaking Bad**: Best show ever debatably. Never ever have or will be so invested or addicted to a show. The characters, story, and originality surpass all other shows. **(9.8/10)**
2. **Bojack Horseman**: Best cartoon show ever created. I am prepared to debate that claim. The first season was misleading for the style of the whole show. I am so excited for season 6 on October 25th. **(9.3/10)**
3. **Rick and Morty**: God this show is a blessing. So funny. Pulls in comedy, science fiction, and other fans. November 10th we get 5 more episodes for season 4! **(9.5/10)**
4. **New Girl**: Nich Miller. Nich f\*cking Miller. A great show with an ""okay"" last season. This is a show that is a perfect length and I can recommend it to many people. **(9.0/10)**
5. **Schitt's Creek**: What an underrated show. A great variety of characters, an intriguing plot, and an interesting setting all add to the magnitude of this show. I love it and more people should too. **(9.0/10)**
6. **Grey's Anatomy**: A long and grueling show but, in my opinion, worth it. This is the first ""big"" show I have conquered and I loved it until season 13. Very good consistency. **(8.5/10)**
7. **Parks and Recreation**: This show is perfect, except for the first season. It is consistently funny and has the right amount of drama to keep many viewers hooked. I'll say it, it's better than The Office. **(9.0/10)**
8. **Better Call Saul**: The absolute perfect follow-up show for Breaking Bad. It's perfect that it also does not just include the backstory of James McGill. It can also be watched without Breaking Bad. **(9.2/10)**
9. **Stranger Things**: So much hype for this show and for good reasons. It takes its own style and reaches out to folks of age and kids who like to see the ""retro"" lifestyle with science fiction. **(9.0/10)**
10. **Adventure Time**: Best childhood show out there. It has the right amount of just fun episodes and a storyline a nerdy adult and a kid can follow and appreciate. Love it, not perfect though. Some episodes are lazy. **(8.0/10)**
11. **Arrow**: The best ""superhero"" show out there. That's bold, but I've watched all Marvel and DC shows but have not enjoyed it as much as Arrow. It does the whole ""flashback"" part very well. **(8.0/10)**
12. **Full House**: Another good childhood favorite of mine. I watched it on DVDs as a kid and I remember just getting so invested in this classic family situational comedy. **(8.4/10)**
13. **The Good Place**: One of the best original plots of the modern-day. The interpretation shown in this show is so funny and can get anyone who is not orthodox religious invested. **(8.8/10)**
14. **Blindspot**: Another underrated show. An original plot for a crime show is something that is overlooked in this show. The character's reactions are so perfect to remind people of true crime. **(7.8/10)**
15. **Orange is the New Black**: Another pretty long show with another original plot. A women's prison, interesting crimes, and classic abuse make this show real enough and still original. **(8.7/10)**",television,"best shows i have watched (OPINION) Watched not too many shows in total (61).

1725,Bojack Horseman S4E11 “Time’s Arrow” is a masterpiece of visual storytelling and character writing,"So I just started watching Bojack Horseman. Up until this point, I’ve been becoming increasingly engrossed in the show, and increasingly aware of its artistic merit as both a dark comedy and an insightful drama, Then I arrived at this episode. And HOLY FUCKING SHIT this show is a masterpiece. 

Everything, from the subtle details of the mother’s distorted memories and perception of reality, with the blank faces, flickering lettering and blurry backgrounds to the abrupt shift in our view of her as a character, are just so masterfully crafted. Up until this point, I’d been inclined to share Bojack’s view of his mother, as a neglectful, shitty parent. Even after the episode where Bojack is at the lake house, I still didn’t view the mother as sympathetic at all. 

Then this episode shows up, and all that is turned on it’s head. This character, who is objectively one of the most reprehensible in the show, is suddenly understandable and human. There have already been some similarly complex character arcs, but I don’t think any of them have been this well written and executed. Basically what I’m I’m trying to say is, this show is a masterclass in crafting complex characters, and not only a standout in the animated genre but as a work of art. If you haven’t watched it yet, put it at the top of your list.",television,"Bojack Horseman S4E11 “Time’s Arrow” is a masterpiece of visual storytelling and character writing So I just started watching Bojack Horseman.

There is also that rant that took place on the bridge with Michonne and Aaron, it did not make any sense to me and felt very random. And that whole ""good guy, bad guy"" talk between those two, felt so out of place. It made more sense with that talk Shane and Rick had in season 2.

It's 20 years old now. It's non-sequitur cutaways have become stale, etc. But season 16 episode 1 is an 8/10. 

Before I say why I recommend this particular episode, I'd recommend to watch a few newer seasons of Family Guy. They've been able to do some really neat stuff with modern animation technology (there's a scene where they're all on a sled together going down a hill and its shot from 6 camera angles. Its glorious). There's also been some hilarious cutaways and pure absurdist humor:

""It was like the time I failed home room.""

Cutaway is teacher doing attendance. 

""Peter Griffin?""

""There!""

This episode is like meta on meta which Family Guy does well, and it spoofs basically ALL of the critically lauded TV shows in one go. Much like South Park, it doesn't take anything too serious and that's where it shines. It takes on like 10 shows in 22 minutes, in spectacular form. It spoofs and pokes fun at them without being too nasty.

IGN gave it a 7.6 but I'd give it an 8. I'd say it is in the top 10 best Family Guy episodes post season 10. It made me laugh out loud many times. Not gonna give away too many jokes but Ty Burrell's live action cameo is the final scene and it's beautiful. Asa Akira also makes a live action cameo. 

The episode uses mostly just the core family in hilarious spoofs (Meg as Claire Danes' character from Homeland had me dying).

1774,Rush is a criminally underrated Australian show,"Whilst the most popular TV series are ostensibly American, or sometimes British given the well-established entertainment industries in these countries, I believe people are missing out on some great shows outside of these areas.

I came upon Rush about 6-7 years ago after watching a lot of Aussie TV whilst staying with family during the summer in NSW. It has remained my favourite show ever since. I started rewatching it this year and it's as compelling as ever. The series follows a specialist police unit called Tactical Response in Melbourne as they catch criminals and save the day. Some stories can be a bit outlandish at times, but the complex narratives and great characters make up for it. Having forgotten a lot of the episodes since seeing it the first time, I am still genuinely surprised when rewatching as I often can't predict what happens next.

1789,History behind how Disney+ has all those 80s/90s Marvel animated shows. Woah.,"Marvel was mainly a comic book company and had no animation studio. So they licensed their characters to other studios to create shows based on them. So the question is that, if Marvel didn't own their shows before being purchased by Disney then how come we can see those shows on Disney+. Well following is the history in quick bullets regarding how Disney came to own those shows.

**DePatie–Freleng/Marvel Produtions/New Wold**

* DePatie–Freleng Enterprises produced the **Spider-Woman (1979)** show.
* Marvel Entertainment acquired DePatie–Freleng in 80s and renamed its studio to Marvel Productions.
* Marvel Productions produced **Spider-Man (1981), Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends (1981) and Incredible Hulk (1982)**
* New World, an independent media company then acquired Marvel Productions in late 80s and renamed Marvel Productions to New World Animation.
* New World Animation produced **Spider-Man (1994), F4 (1994) and Iron Man (1994)**
* Fox then acquired New World in mid 90s.

**Saban Entertainment**

* Saban Entertainment produced **X-Men (1994)**

**Fox Family Worldwide (New World and Saban)**

* Saban and Fox Kids merged and created a new JV named Fox Family worldwide. So it now owned the following  

   * Saban Entertainment studio
   * New World Animation library
   * Fox Kids Network
* Saban Entertainment then produced **Silver Surfer (1998), Spider-Man Unlimited (1999)** and **Avengers United they Stand (1999)**
* Disney then acquired the Fox Family Worldwide (Saban Entertainment Studio, New World Animation library and Network). Disney later named this company ABC Family and renamed the network to Freeform.

So that is why we can see all those Marvel's 70s/80s/90s shows on Disney+. Woah isnt this interesting? If so many mergers hadn't happened in the past then just like pre-MCU movies being owned by non-Disney studios like Sony (Raimi Spider-Man, Amazing Spider-Man), Fox (acquired by Disney too!!), Lionsgate (Manthing, Punisher), NewLine (Blade), Universal (Hulk), these animated shows would've also been owned by non-Disney companies and we wouldn't be seeing them on Disney+.",television,"History behind how Disney+ has all those 80s/90s Marvel animated shows.

1795,Are we about to see the best Scifi entertainment block in years?," November and December look to be packed with with good stuff. Star wars kicks off disney+ with the mandalorian. Then we have the fallen jedi game(fingers crossed it isnt a micro transaction shitfest). Then we get season 4 of the expanse on amazon. Then we get the rise of skywalker in the cinema. And then to top it all off, we have season 2 of lost in space on christmas eve.

I grew up in the 80s and 90s and as anyone who was there will tell you, scifi was everywhere. So much so that I took scifi shows for granted. Star trek was everywhere. Three shows, two going at once. Ds9 and babylon 5 blew the doors off of what could be done with serial tv shows. The x files captured the fascination of alien invaders and conspiracy theories of the time perfectly. Stargate took an OK movie plot and turned into a decades long staple of scifi fans weekly viewing.

Scifi movies were plentiful. terminator 2, alien 3(it wasnt that bad), star trek movies every other year, star wars came back to the big screen, the fifth element, starship troopers, total recall, event horizon, strange days, independence day, the matrix. The list goes on forever. It feels like, since the start of the new millennium that scifi has taken a back seat in popular culture to vampires and criminal science. We've had some great scifi stuff(Battlestar), but its never felt plentiful the way it did in the 90s. Even the channel named scifi changed its name to syfy, and started showing wrestling.

Ive noticed a steady upswing not only in scifi shows and movies popularity, but also in their quality. And to be honest Ive missed it. The 90s were a special time for scifi shows and Im honestly excited to see this much scifi entertainment coming in such a condensed block. It feels cosy, comforting. Like coming home again.

Personally, I'd like an Alien TV show that explores more into Weiland Yutani, explores more of the different types of aliens, or entirely new aliens. It just seems like such an awesome world and nobody is doing much with it other than a movie every now and again. Would be a tad expensive but it can be done with a talented crew and a nice budget.

Even the line ""Give me the hope to run out of steam"" has significance as the basic theme of the finale. All of the characters are pitching a hypothetical season 7, but it's only a gesture towards the love of the show and the characters, not an actual desire to continue. They all — Jeff especially — need to let go of Greendale in order to move on with their lives. Their love for that place and each other needs to run out of steam.

There's no way Dan Harmon could have predicted this result when that song was chosen as the opening. I think that's got a nice poetry to it.

1914,In Praise of TCM...,"TCM doesn't get the respect it deserves. Full movies played without commercial interruption, book-ended by thoughtful discussions, interesting anecdotes, and historical context to fan favorites and forgotten classics. I could watch a channel just dedicated to the newsreels, propaganda, promos, and other fascinating short subject pieces played between films. TCM also does an excellent job playing insightful interviews, either original or archived, from the personnel involved first hand in the productions. 

In the past I enjoyed watching TCM because it was soothing and comforting to watch old movies. It was a nice background channel to doze off to. Robert Osborne had a calming grandfatherly voice.

The real praise is for their recent programming. TCM has noticeably been trying to appeal to a younger demographic the past several years. At first glance I was real worried about the integrity of the station. Usually when any corporate entity tries to pivot like this it can be a real /r/Cringetopia meets /r/FellowKids. Instead TCM has pushed incredibly thoughtful programming series that feel like you're getting a minor in film history, going out of their way to highlight issues in the film industry that have largely gone untouched in Hollywood. 

Recent Examples:

Film series on people with disabilities

Footage of House Un-American activities with contextual interviews

Chronological Blaxploitation series - A serious discussion with an historian of African Americans and film followed each film. (This series was incredible) 

Film series highlighting female directors 

LGBTQ classics series

**EDIT** List of TCM ""Underground"" films https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCM_Underground

Documentary about Tab Hunter - Both focusing on the struggle of being a closeted homosexual and life as an actor whose career straddled the studio contract system.

(There are more, these are just off the top of my head)

It's not just social issues, the silent era programming blows by socks off every time. They recently played all the James Bond films (stopping at the Dan Craig era) accompanied by production interviews and retrospectives. There was a hilarious series of 60's sex comedies I'd never heard of, Classic Sci-Fi B movies, and they still play fan favorite classics: Hitchcock, Wilder, Capra, etc...

TCM could have easily slipped into becoming Turner Convalescence Movies as background noise for nursing homes, playing Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, and John Wayne films on a loop. So I applaud them for not just staying relevant, but doing so in a thoughtful and entertaining manner.  

My main criticism of TCM is that when they pull punches, they pull them hard. Often times diving deep into an actor or director's life and then drawing the line at the most fascinating and controversial points of their career. Or ignoring some very serious wrongdoings by famous producers/directors they're highlighting. 

Also the tribute to Ted Turner fluff piece they've been airing the past month or two has been laughable. Making the guy look like the savior of Hollywood and film.

1985,How to prepare for watchmen HBO,"Hi all!

I'm new to the watchmen franchise and am going to be watching the HBO show. As the show is posed as a watchmen sequel, I was curious what the easiest method would be to be prepared for the premiere so that I'm not confused as to what's going on in the episode. I'm not trying to read the entire comic - not my scene. A review I read suggested reading the wiki to cover my bases. Thoughts?

I have never been so happy to be a part of a show like I am with this one. Jim Gavin and Peter Ocko have written an absolutely beautiful show. It centers around a group of somewhat down on their luck folks in Long Beach, CA, who have the great good fortune to join a fading mystical fraternal order (a tiny bit like the Masons or Elks Club) called The Order Of The Lynx, specifically Lodge # 49. Their lives begin to change and grow in so many weird and wonderful ways. These characters are SO real, it’s crazy! The best thing is: the show is very funny and very human. It’s real and a little surreal, joyous and sometimes melancholy, down to earth and transcendent. It’s full of Life! And it gives you a real uplifting charge. I love it SO much it’s almost weird. Almost.

anyway, i’m here to answer whatever you got!

P.S. LODGE 49 airs Monday nights at 10pm ET/9pm PT. Season 1 is on Hulu! Season 2 is AMC.com! Both seasons are available on Amazon Prime and iTunes!

2049,Thou Shalt Not Kill (Non Uccidere) Season 3,"**For anyone already familiar with this show...**

Do you know when season 3 is coming to the US? I know it premiered in Italy last December but despite frequent Googling, I haven’t heard any news about when it might be available from US (or UK) distributors. Unfortunately, my Italian is still pretty crap and I’m hopeless unless I have subtitles, so I can’t watch the show without them.

**A little bit about the show for anyone curious...**

[Thou Shalt Not Kill](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5022622/) is an excellent Italian series about a young, highly intuitive detective with a murky past and the challenging and often quite intricate crimes she solves. I realize that sounds fairly standard for a detective show, but I feel this one distinguishes itself in subtle, yet appreciable ways that make it a standout.

For instance, the main character’s insights feel like a wholly earned combination of dogged determination and natural intuition, instead of manifesting as a “sudden epiphany” near the end of every episode. She is guarded, but deeply empathetic in spite of that, which helps a lot with the connections she makes. Also, each investigation unfolds over the course of two episodes, allowing enough attention to be paid to all the characters on both sides of the investigation, as well as red herrings and sub plots. 

The writing is excellent IMO - this is the only procedural detective show where I’ve never once been able to guess the outcome accurately - which I love. Red herrings are always plausible, and even minor actors are nuanced enough to keep you on your toes. The show is also visually striking, with high production values and beautiful Italian scenery.",television,"Thou Shalt Not Kill (Non Uccidere) Season 3 **For anyone already familiar with this show...**

2051,What are your Top 10 favourite live action television series?,"Movies are definitely a great source of entertainment, and while it’s always great to be in the moment when watching a decent movie, it’s a fun ride to watch a television series. Each episode feels like a mini-movie in a long franchise. That’s the joy of watching TV shows. Sometimes they can be weak, sometimes they can be the best thing you’ve watched in a long time. Either way, you’re being entertained non-stop and it feels like there’s a sequel everytime you’re left on a cliffhanger. So here is my list of my Top 10 personal favourite live action television series!

# My Top 10 Favourite Live Action Television Series: 

10.) **DC’s Legends of Tomorrow**

Starting off in my list is DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Me being a sucker for time travel stories, this show is basically a big treat for that. It’s very fun to watch and has a really decent cast to keep me watching. The reason it is very low on my list is because recently, it has really been losing its charm. Only a few moments here and there kept me entertained. Doesn’t change the fact that I will keep watching this show till it’s cancelled or finished. It’s filled with a lot of fun history references and has enough sci-fi action to keep me thrilled. 

9.) **The Flash** 

Easily my favourite series in the Arrowverse. The first and second season are easily the best seasons in this show. After that, this is the reason why this show is also really low on my list. Regardless, it is still a damn good show. Grant Gustin IS the Flash. Nobody could play a better Barry Allen than Grant Gustin. He’s just that perfect. My other only nitpick is Iris. She’s extremely annoying. Other than that, this show has a lot of great villains, such as the Reverse-Flash, Zoom, Trickster, Thinker, Captain Cold, etc. and great supporting characters like Cisco, Caitlyn, Harrison Wells (Choose your pick…), Ralph, etc. It also has a really great theme song. 

8.) **Daredevil**

This series is basically the art of a superhero series. There’s so many things that are shown, which causes you to really think hard about what’s going on. I like those kinds of shows, which don’t always have drama just for the sake of drama, and gives you justified stretched out scenes that tell the story without having to always use dialogue. My personal favourite is with Wilson Fisk. There’s this scene where he looks in the mirror and sees his child self covered in blood. There’s a meaning behind that, and I love how that is enough to say everything without having to say a thing. Aside from that, even the other characters like the main hero, Daredevil, is a really awesome character. We see his evolution into a hero, how he began to feel conflicted in many situations, and how he always stands by his morals. This show also perfectly introduced one of my favourite Marvel superheroes, the Punisher. The action scenes are AMAZING. Then there’s not just the action scenes, but the intense moments. This series just has me at the edge of my seat when during the intense moments, and has me watching carefully at the little things painted in the show. Just… wow. 

7.) **Stranger Things** 

This is a really amazing show that gives a really good nod to eighties films. It’s a series stretched into an eighties story. It’s basically got nearly everything. The teen drama, the supernatural horror, the government conspiracies, the goonies-like adventure kids, etc. The series surprised me on every level when I first watched it and I still adore it to this day. It leaves me with practically every emotion. Sometimes I’d be laughing my ass off, and other times I would be terrified out of my mind. It had great and complex characters, even turning one of my least favourite characters from Season 1 into one of my top favourite characters from Season 3. Nearly everyone had a decent arc. I hope Season 4 will come soon because I’m just not ready for it to end yet. It’s that good.  

6.) **Lost** 

This is probably the best mystery adventure show out there. It’s rather difficult to find a really good series that focuses on mysteries. This is definitely the best at doing that. It starts out as a survival story, where the survivors of a plane crash need to work together to stay alive after finding themselves stranded on an island. Then they realize they’re not alone. That’s when things really get real. It has really menacing villains and pretty well written characters, thanks to the flashbacks which I personally never really had a problem with. In fact, that’s one of the criticisms I disagree with. While I do kind of agree that they got a little too repetative, I still loved them to understand the characters more. There are also clues left all over the series to answer the questions to some of the bigger mysteries in the series. My only nitpick is the ending. Not that it left me hanging, but because it got me down! Also, literally being a story about good vs evil felt way too generic in what it originally was. Regardless, this is still a damn excellent show. My favourite character would have to be Sawyer. He’s just so damn likable. You hate him at first, then you just love his every sarcastic remark and snarky personality.  

5.) **Once Upon a Time** 

As someone who really loves seeing twists on my favourite childhood stories, this show is very good at doing that. I mainly came for this show for Captain Hook, due to him being my favourite Disney Villain, but I ended up staying for Rumplestiltskin because he was just so freaking complex and well written. Like all tv series, it’s going to have weak episodes and seasons, but as a whole, it is still a very decent series. My personal favourite season is the Neverland arc, due to Peter Pan being one of my favourite childhood stories. Seeing Peter Pan as a full blown psychopathic villain was really awesome. The main characters are amazing as well such as Emma, Regina, Snow, David, Henry, Grumpy, Zelena and even Killian to a certain extent. Overall, seeing my favourite fairy tale characters and stories being twisted into a really exciting television series is one of the best things ever. 

4.) **Friends** 

By far my favourite sitcom. It is the funniest show I’ve seen in decades. There are just so many jokes that are very well written, and the main cast are just so damn good. You’d think that a show following a group of friends having everyday lives would be boring, but oh boy, this show is just a fun show. Ross is easily the most hilarious, then there’s Chandler’s one-liners who make the icing on the cake. The drama that happens are definitely good enough, but overall, it’s still a very fun series and I could watch it over and over again. 

3.) **The Walking Dead** 

An awesome apocalypse show based on a zombie apocalypse. Following a group of survivors as they battle their humanity in order to protect one another is one of the sole plot of this series. It shows who the real monsters are, humans or animals. The zombies are merely just eating people because that’s all they do. People killing people because they need to… or they want to. That’s one of the best concepts of this show. Aside from the fact that I am a sucker for apocalypse-themed movies/shows, this series is easily the best at being this. I especially love Negan, the main antagonist in Season 6B to the end of Season 8.  

2.) **Breaking Bad** 

This is the show that felt like it never ended. It started out pretty slow but once things kicked in, it got REALLY good. At first, I thought this show was probably overrated. I gave this movie a hard pass on my first viewing after three episodes, but when my whole family started watching it and enjoying it, I just had to give it one more try and I am glad I did. It is a really intense and dark show, but thanks to Saul Goodman, he was there a few times to lighten the mood. I absolutely love the two main characters, Jesse Pinkman and Walter White, aka Heisenberg. Jesse started out as the jerkass, but eventually became one of most lovable character in the series who you just root for in the end. Then there’s Walt… Oh boy! I just want to say, I love stories which focus on a main protagonist eventually becoming the villain of their own story. Walter White is NO exception. He starts out as a mild-mannered but well-meaning good guy until he eventually transforms into a loathsome villain. The villains were great too, such as the short-lived but unforgettable Tuco and the menacingly sophisticated Gustavo Fring. Mike was also a really awesome character. One minute he’d beat your face in, next he is drinking beer with you. What a guy! I especially loved the movie that came out recently. A perfect closure-ending to a really damn excellent show.  

1.) **Gotham** 

What a ride. What started out as a typical crime drama show ended up becoming what I came to see, a decent prequel series focusing on the characters of Gotham before Batman. What I love are the character developments. Especially Edward Nygma, the Riddler. He starts out as a genuinely nice guy who only wanted to have friends, only to turn into one of the most fearsome villains the city has ever seen. The Penguin is also a really awesome character. He’s sympathetic enough for you to root for him in nearly everything, though I was on the Riddler’s side when he and the Penguin ended up fighting each other. Gordon was a decent protagonist, and following young Bruce and Alfred’s story was really engaging. However, I also loved seeing the nods to the other Batman villains in the series such as the Joker, Mr Freeze, Zsasz, Hugo Strange, Court of Owls, Ra’s Al Ghul, Bane, Scarecrow, Mad Hatter, etc. Great action scenes and great story arcs. Overall, my favourite series ever. 

So what are YOUR Top 10 favourite live action television series and why? :D",television,"What are your Top 10 favourite live action television series? Movies are definitely a great source of entertainment, and while it’s always great to be in the moment when watching a decent movie, it’s a fun ride to watch a television series. Each episode feels like a mini-movie in a long franchise. That’s the joy of watching TV shows. Sometimes they can be weak, sometimes they can be the best thing you’ve watched in a long time. Either way, you’re being entertained non-stop and it feels like there’s a sequel everytime you’re left on a cliffhanger. So here is my list of my Top 10 personal favourite live action television series!

# My Top 10 Favourite Live Action Television Series: 

10.) **DC’s Legends of Tomorrow**

Starting off in my list is DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Me being a sucker for time travel stories, this show is basically a big treat for that. It’s very fun to watch and has a really decent cast to keep me watching. The reason it is very low on my list is because recently, it has really been losing its charm. Only a few moments here and there kept me entertained. Doesn’t change the fact that I will keep watching this show till it’s cancelled or finished. It’s filled with a lot of fun history references and has enough sci-fi action to keep me thrilled. 

9.) **The Flash** 

Easily my favourite series in the Arrowverse. The first and second season are easily the best seasons in this show. After that, this is the reason why this show is also really low on my list. Regardless, it is still a damn good show. Grant Gustin IS the Flash. Nobody could play a better Barry Allen than Grant Gustin. He’s just that perfect. My other only nitpick is Iris. She’s extremely annoying. Other than that, this show has a lot of great villains, such as the Reverse-Flash, Zoom, Trickster, Thinker, Captain Cold, etc. and great supporting characters like Cisco, Caitlyn, Harrison Wells (Choose your pick…), Ralph, etc. It also has a really great theme song. 

8.) **Daredevil**

This series is basically the art of a superhero series. There’s so many things that are shown, which causes you to really think hard about what’s going on. I like those kinds of shows, which don’t always have drama just for the sake of drama, and gives you justified stretched out scenes that tell the story without having to always use dialogue. My personal favourite is with Wilson Fisk. There’s this scene where he looks in the mirror and sees his child self covered in blood.

2063,Primal just wrecked my weekend and I feel so sad now.,"As a big Tartakovsky fan I will watch anything he does so I started watching Primal this week. It reminds me of the Tom and Jerry or Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote shorts they'd play before the main feature in cinemas, all sound and vision but no extended dialogue. The first three episodes I found myself enjoying the somewhat antagonistic relationship between Fang the female dinosaur and Spear the caveman, bonded by the losses of their families to the horned nose dinosaurs. Episode 3 is probably my favourite because of the Mammoths hunt to retrieve their elders tusk to place it at their graveyard with both sides being unrelenting and brutal until then Spear realises what they want, gives it to them and they leave solemnly to do their duty.

However I've just finished the last episode and I was screaming at the TV as Fang did her best to fight off and buy time against the hulked out gorilla that won the Thunderdome contest for the honour of killing Spear and Fang. When he crippled her leg, I was so angry. It was a relief to see Spear free himself and exact revenge but the last 30 seconds where he goes to check on her and she doesn't move at all... I was almost moved to tears by a goddamn dead animated dinosaur being mourned by a cartoon caveman. I know it's all just pretty pictures in sequence but I've not been this upset by a cartoon since Grave of The Fireflies. 

I'm hoping the show gets renewed and somehow Fang can be nursed back to health and isn't actually dead but after she spat up blood and got her leg totally crippled...

I take it that red head sister was just ranked or whatever you'd call it as Gamma? It was super cool to have the Whisperers get spotlight on their own for once. Look.... the Governor's ppl and the Saviors, they got NOTHING on the Whisperers..... every other villain shown is just a common thug compared to these guys, and I like that. 

And Alpha, she is not entirely what she makes herself out to be. She showed full blown weakness in front of Beta, on purpose of course, and that was cool to see. It was great to see different sides of these characters. I was really invested in this episode. Well done, Angela Kang. Well done! 

I am considering rewatching the first episode, I feel I may have been too harsh on it. Said it was just iffy. Some goofy things took place in that episode, but I will rewatch I think. 

The actors for Alpha and Beta are killer actors!

It's my cousin's house."" (I will try that with the cops next time I want something in my cousin's house.) 7- Daddy issues ""You are just a girl."" ( Like a dad trying to protect his children is persecution.). 8-Chinese female rebel operates an illegal clinic in a basement because society doesn't take care of the poor. 9- Steals Batman's equipment because he abandoned her ( A little entitled if you ask me.). 10- Kick everybody's ass because ""Girl power"" you know. 11- Interminable moralistic speeches (We got it girl. The world is not fair). 12- Black male reduced to a week sidekick job because we all know that LGBTQ trumps black people unless they are part of LGBTQ. In that case they get back on top of the list. That was just the content of the show. Now to the technical aspect. People who can't act. Terrible CGI andFight scenes that have so many cuts (like Taken because Liam Neeson can't do fight scenes anymore). It reminded me of Captain Marvel (But Captain Marvel didn't come out.). In conclusion, this is dog chit.

The world is not fair). 12- Black male reduced to a week sidekick job because we all know that LGBTQ trumps black people unless they are part of LGBTQ. In that case they get back on top of the list. That was just the content of the show. Now to the technical aspect. People who can't act. Terrible CGI andFight scenes that have so many cuts (like Taken because Liam Neeson can't do fight scenes anymore). It reminded me of Captain Marvel (But Captain Marvel didn't come out.). In conclusion, this is dog chit.

2119,Crossing the Rubicon - Phillip Price and Truxton Spangler,"Originally posted to r/MrRobot

Anyone who follows *Mr. Robot*, who also managed to follow AMC's fantastic (although fleeting) series *Rubicon* will instantly recognize the untapped-potential of **Michael Cristofer**'s **Truxton Spangler** finally realized in his titanic role as *Mr. Robot*'s **Phillip Price**. As I'm sure I'm not the first to observe (in fact I know I'm not; [here's an insightful article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/arts/television/rubicon-amc-stream.html) that actually touches on its influence on *Mr. Robot*), *Rubicon* is, in many ways, a direct-precursor to *Mr. Robot*. From a thematic standpoint, both shows deal with the manipulation of truth, the slippery slope of paranoia, and the ways in which the analytical/intellectual powers of deeply-flawed/troubled individuals are misappropriated by the invisible hands that move us all. Even those with the best intentions often find they too are accessories to the ""plots-within-plots"" of unseen one-percenters. (**TL;DR at the end**)

# ""They hide in plain view""

But back to my point. There are two scenes in particular where the dialogue and Michael Cristofer's delivery are *so* similar, I can't help but wonder if it wasn't an intentional callback. Spoilers ahead. Starting with *Mr. Robot* is a scene we're all familiar with, which anyone will remember as the moment it's made clear the magnitude of forces Elliot is up against. And it's Michael Cristofer's delivery in one particular point in the exchange that caught my eye: [here](https://youtu.be/arQ2h-0_4Y4?t=125).

&gt;\[...\] And we **will** ***handle*** **that person... as we** ***usually do***.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Phillip Price, *Mr. Robot* E110, ""eps1.9\_zer0-day.avi""

Which struck me, because it's so, *so* similar to another scene from *Rubicon*. Even within the context of the stories, both scenes parallel one another, featuring an exchange between two of their respective show's most enigmatic figures. On one side, we have an eccentric (if fastidious) executive, whose outward nature bellies a darker menace. On the other, we have something of an unknown quantity, as-of-yet unclear to us if they're an ally or threat to our troubled, paranoid protagonist--whose fate they discuss, naturally, only in the vaguest of terms: [here](https://youtu.be/m7Yxvd3ky3U?t=74).

&gt;If he is, **he will be** ***handled.***.. as ***problems*** ***are***.""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Truxton Spangler, *Rubicon* E109, ""No Honesty In Men""

# ""Not every conspiracy is a theory""

I've never posted to this sub before, so perhaps someone has already made this observation, but I thought it was worth sharing in the event nobody had. It would be worth noting the similarities between Michael Cristofer's performances as Truxton Spangler and Phillip Price alone, but the fact that *Mr. Robot* features a line nearly-identical to the above quoted line from *Rubicon* (the lessons from which very well may have made its own existence possible), with the context in which both lines are delivered paralleling one another so closely, makes it difficult *not* to suspect Esmail knew *exactly* what he was doing here. Which, if true, reminds me of [another quote](https://youtu.be/ibI6TopNxGE?t=48):

&gt;Someone either didn't expect the pattern to be caught, **or wasn't afraid if it** ***was***.""

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** *Mr. Robot* and AMC's *Rubicon* both have menacing characters played by Michael Cristofer, who delivers an eerily-similar menacing line in both shows (links above), and I don't think it's a coincidence.

2125,"If you haven't already, I highly recommend checking out the new Creepshow series for some quality spooky entertainment this Halloween.","Creepshow was  an anthology film that came out in 1982 and was written by Stephen King and directed by George Romero. The movie consisted of several different stories that were supposed to have the feel of old horror comics from the 1950s (ala Tales from the Crypt and Vault of Horror). As a result, the movie was deliberately a mix between black humor, horror, practical effects and pure camp. 

 With that being said, the new TV series (currently halfway through its short run) is absolutely fantastic. Each episode is around 40 minutes and contains two original or adapted segments and I have been absolutely amazed with how it has turned out so far.

The episodes try not to get into contemporary issues (like Black Mirror or Twilight Zone), but instead embraces its cheesiness in full glory. The practical effects are phenomenal, the stories range from terrifying to bizarre, and it is overall a fun watch.

The only downside is that it is  only streaming on Shutter but I believe it is possible to get a 30 day free trial (I believe the streaming service is worth it though).

I wanted so badly to walk away from the show uplifted and satisfied but I'm really really sour about the entire third season and I need to put some thoughts down about my fav characters that got did dirty: 

Hecate - just fuckin shot bro built up for an entire season as devious and ambitious and formidable and BANG all u did was dry out, fuck a werewolf, and summon six snakes that didn't even kill everyone they were supposed to??? I HAD DREAMS FOR THIS BITCH I LOVED THIS BITCH 

Cat 'definitely not a mary sue' Death Doctor - ""who are you?"" ""i believe i'm the woman that just saved your life"" like bro you're in his house just answer the question this exchange got to me so hard like i could feel the writer being like 'yeahhhhh yeaaaH that's how you write a strong female character - just make her ....... rude.' and then the full minute of her arguing with sir malcolm about his neck because he didn't want to listen to a woman???? I'm assuming that they were expecting a fourth season and she was going to play a greater part of it in the long term but try to pitch 'Super Hot, Incredibly Dangerous with Swords, Immune to being Afraid, Very Young and a genius beautiful sexy Expert In Her Field, and just Puts Men In Their Place For No Reason' to a room full of women and see how far that gets 

Lily - I cried watching this show two times, both during the third season, and both during scenes where women were being held against their will. 

I was promised a coup of women transforming the streets of Victorian London with an immortal fury. Instead I got fuck face Dorian selling out his only companion for being an ambitious and furious woman to fuck face Victor who literally wants to 'cure' her? and I mean the clear parallels between her situation with victor and the episode about Vanessa's time in the hospital and the concept of 'fixing' someone. I cried when Lily realized that she had been betrayed and that she was about to be chemically lobotomized by someone who wanted to FUCK HER INCAPACITATED BODY FOR THE REST OF HER IMMORTAL LIFE. I was horrified! I can't imagine anything worse in the entire world! I bawled! I thought, surely, this woman is going to get the furious revenge that her character has been built upon. 

JK she has to tell victor a traumatizing story to make him reconsider her as an actual human being and after he lets her go she just....... dips. And says some mean words to Dorian after he murdered Justine - Lily's 'soul puppet' - and, I cannot stress this enough, TRAFFICKED HER FOR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND SEXUAL ASSAULT

and she's just like 'wow ur like super boring and hurtful i'm gonna go' 

????????????

????!?!??!??!!!!!!?!??!?!?!?!!!

I'm furious

Justine - murdered. A energizing presence in the story, the conflict that she sparked between Lily and Dorian was incredible and made me think that Dorian was about to do one interesting fucking thing in the grand scheme of this entire show but nope just more boring impassive expressions as commits the most boring murders in the entire show

Vanessa - I don't even want to get into it 

Ethan's Apache Dad - Maybe it's because I'm American but boy is it hard to write a Native American character into a show without seeming like the person who wrote it is just Making Shit Up about Native Americans which .... I mean I guess they made a bunch of shit up about traditional Christian mythology so who am I to draw the line but the cave paintings???? 

Ethan - Look at what they did to my beautiful boy's head. Look at what they did to my beautiful boy's ethics - but only for two episodes that literally fell flat into nothingness and then didn't even end with a werewolf v. dracula fight like.............. what Even Is The Point

I actually think this is a better show than Misfits!

Howard Overman created this a year later than Misfits season one, 2010, it got a second season but it remains quietly forgotten. Unlike Misfits, that skyrocketed in fame.

However, the stars of the show are now huge actors, Toby Stephens (Lost on Space, Black Sails), son of Maggie Smith, and Lucy Punch (A Series of Unfortunate Event, Motherland). As you'd expect, their central performances are incredible.

It centres around two cops in London and their cases in each episode. It feels like an irreverent sitcom. Stephens' character is totally unprofessional and self serving, it's hilarious. Punch's character is generally quite exasperated at his actions. They have a very funny dynamic.

An extract from Wikipedia that describes it well:

The Guardian's Sam Wollaston also liked it, saying ""It's cheeky, irreverent, puerile, sometimes inappropriate. It also made me laugh, almost out loud a few times, and that's no bad thing in a comedy"" and again praised Stephens's ""fabulous"" acting, while Punch's performance was ""excellent"".[7] He asserted: ""Toby Stephens is fabulous as übertwerp Jack. He has a nice, pleased-as-punch-with-himself complacency, changing his voice and raising an eyebrow when he talks to ladies. There's a hint of self-doubt there, but not enough to stop him being a total cock. And Lucy Punch as Kate is excellent at being appalled by him, but also just a tiny bit impressed, even attracted to him. Together they're wonderfully awful.""


Anyway, this show was on the BBC and is currently is on the UK Netflix. It went for two series.

I have only just started watching it. I am surprised this never gained more popularity or atleast a cult following. CAS in point: This is the first post on this subreddit about Vexed. I couldn't find any others. 

It's a forgotten gem.

Has anyone else seen this? What do you think of the show?

He has a nice, pleased-as-punch-with-himself complacency, changing his voice and raising an eyebrow when he talks to ladies. There's a hint of self-doubt there, but not enough to stop him being a total cock. And Lucy Punch as Kate is excellent at being appalled by him, but also just a tiny bit impressed, even attracted to him. Together they're wonderfully awful.""


Anyway, this show was on the BBC and is currently is on the UK Netflix. It went for two series.

I have only just started watching it. I am surprised this never gained more popularity or atleast a cult following. CAS in point: This is the first post on this subreddit about Vexed. I couldn't find any others. 

It's a forgotten gem.

Has anyone else seen this? What do you think of the show?

Although - I have seen on wiki that Howard Overman and Lucy Punch were no longer involved in the show in its second series. Does anyone know why? Did the popularity of Misfits get in the way of Vexed?",0

We could see more of Amber Atkins working at the funeral home part-time, the Leeman's messed up home life, Annette and Loretta's shenanigans, the Amy Adams and Brittany Murphy characters could be supporting characters who play friends of Amber. The show could also focus on the class divide between Annette, Loretta, and Amber and the Leemans in small town Minnesota. It could still have the dark humor of the film but with less psycho Gladys killing.

I was bored and figured hey why not, there's some martial arts. Holy shit though, the martial arts was like watching the kung fu movies from the 70s but with the violence of the kung fu/martial arts of Kill Bill.  Animation quality was pretty damn good, just like Castlevania (though there is one scene where a truck slides in and my brother and I were like what, the truck was animated fine and suddenly is just like a sliding image).

As for the story I wouldn't call it complex or anything but it was enjoyable. It's set in Mexico post Vietnam War, and is basically a story of the cartel messing with the wrong town. I don't want to go into much detail, but you could watch the netflix trailer (I don't believe it gives anything beyond plot points beyond the first episode).

TL;DR: I rambled, but give this show a chance.

CBS dropped the ball putting this in their niche streaming service because I think it would do well with audience if it was available for everyone to see.

The show follows 3 time period and we get to see different couples and to what led to a death in each time period. One of the character husband is called Rob. He cheats on his wife, she finds out accidentally without his knowledge and even befriends his mistress so as to put a stop to the affair. 

This guy is an absolute misogynist, cheat but worse of all, he let his wife think he is responsible for the death of their daughter, fucking bastard!

2233,"The Leftovers s03e04 is one of the best episodes of television to ever air, but not just because of the fight between Kevin and Nora [spoiler alert]","Another user posted a video of the dramatic fight between Kevin and Nora, and there's no argument as to the intensity of that moment.  However, there's a nuance that those who don't have schizophrenia may miss.  It was so well done, though! If you want to get an idea of what it is like living with schizophrenia, just look at how the show perfectly set up a delusion.

Kevin sees Evie outside of G'day Melbourne and hops in a cab to go find her.  When he finally has her cornered he launches in to a paranoid interrogation, and Evie is visibly upset.  Fortunately, Kevin sent a pic of Evie to Laurie as proof that she's alive, and it's that pic that Laurie has him look at that brings Kevin out of his delusion.

That scene was just so beautifully set up.  Kevin and Nora know their relationship is ending, and that stress is really starting to eat at his mind.  The sex in the bathroom at the airport - that sexual lashing out is a coping mechanism some schizophrenics use to exercise control over something in their lives.  That stress leads Kevin's mind to see things that aren't there or see them differently than they are, and that's when Kevin sees Evie.

The thing about a delusion is that it doesn't affect just the life of the person having the delusion; it affects the lives of anyone that delusion is projected towards.  In this case, Kevin's delusion scared the daylights out of a random Muslim woman who was there to hold a sign up for G'day Melbourne.  He held her against her will and interrogated her because he thought she was someone else.

But the tragedy of it all is that Laurie, his first wife, is the only one with the grip on his heart to pull him out of the delusion.  Without her, Kevin could slip in to his mind and never come back. That's just one reason why the stakes are so high in their fight later in the episode.

From my perspective, it's because this is the first show I've ever seen to get schizophrenia right and get it right so well (Legion being a close second) that this episode strikes home with me as probably the best episode of television to ever air.",television,"The Leftovers s03e04 is one of the best episodes of television to ever air, but not just because of the fight between Kevin and Nora [spoiler alert] Another user posted a video of the dramatic fight between Kevin and Nora, and there's no argument as to the intensity of that moment.

2236,"With the recent trend of fantasy adventure books being adapted into big budget shows due to the success of GoT, is there any upcoming sci fi books/series being adapted as well (like the Hyperion Cantos)?","[Sorry had to repost due to vague title post before]

Do you think Netflix, HBO, Amazon would ever pick up a show on this book series? Adapting the book(s) would probably be more difficult for a movie. 

I could see the first book’s Canterbury Tales style chapter structure being broken down into an hour-long episode for each of the main characters backstory. And then maybe an episode at the beginning for an intro episode. And then one or two episodes for the final chapter when all the characters are together. Could be similar to Lost structure where each episode starts with present day and then has flashbacks to the past for one character per episode (obviously in the book the characters literally sit down and tell their past stories/connection). And then the subsequent books don’t really need the full-episode flashback sequences. 

Some potential issues for networks/studios I could see arise:

1.	Budget necessary for this scale of show. Would be hard to make set pieces for all the different worlds. But over use of green screen would probably look like shit. 
2.	Only 4 books. Might not be long enough for a big network investment. 
3.	The big time jump from the first two books to the last two books. Would require new characters for audience to get attached to.
4.	The structure of the first book. The necessary in-depth backstories might make the first few episodes feel a bit disjointed. It would probably feel more like a mini-series then a traditional tv show. 

Some potential positives networks might see though:

1.	Great story that kind of fits between pure sci fi genre and pure fantasy adventure genre.
2.	Amazing amazing world building (GoT showed people love a world/series with a rich backstory that could be explored).
3.	The Shrike provides that intriguing villain that looms over the whole show with a mysterious unknown background. Where does it come from, who created it, why did they create it, what are the full extent of its powers. Kind of similar to the White Walkers before Benioff shit the bed (sorry about all the GoT comparisons). 
4.	Solid ‘twist/surprise’ with the Consul. 
3.	The show ‘The Terror’ on AMC was successfully adapted from another book of the author of Hyperion, Dan Simmons.
4.	Bradley Cooper once wanted to adapt it into a movie 5 years ago or so (and then I guess teamed with Syfy to adapt it for TV?) before going into creative/development hell. 

I thought initially it wouldn’t translate well to film/TV or might be too expensive. But Altered Carbon looked pretty solid given the scale and all the CGI (regardless of how good you thought that shows story was). I feel like a movie would be extremely difficult to flesh out 5 (or was it 6?) full ‘unrelated/distinct’ backstories and tie it all together for the relatively anticlimactic first book ending in 2 hours. 

Game of thrones opened the door for all these new big budget fantasy/adventure shows coming out soon - lord of the rings, the Witcher, wheel of time, his dark materials. There doesn’t seem to be as much of an audience for big budget sci fi shows though. Star Trek and the Expanse are good and have decent sized budgets. Altered Carbon and Lost in Space kind of disappointed in story but delivered in cinematography/budget. I haven’t seen older sci fi shows like Stargate.",television,"With the recent trend of fantasy adventure books being adapted into big budget shows due to the success of GoT, is there any upcoming sci fi books/series being adapted as well (like the Hyperion Cantos)?

2254,Hosting a watch party with 10 of my furthest strangers. Please talk me out of it.,"I've been thinking about hosting a watch party for the new season of Rick &amp; Morty but none of my friends watch the show and I don't feel like explaining the last 3 seasons in order to catch them up. So right now, I'll just end up watching it alone which sucks because that's all I ever do... sit on my couch and watch tv by myself.

And then I had a thought. Could be a stupid thought but I wanted to get input before I decided whether to do it or not.

Basically I would invite 10 or so people over to my house, charge like $15 bucks, order a bunch of food, buy some liquor, and we watch the premiere together.

Of course, I'd figure out some way to make sure the people aren't crazies but anyone have any other reasons why this is a bad idea? 

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I not be charging for it? I ask my co-worker and he said that I shouldn't be charging but I was trying to make it more like a movie theater experience with the food and drinks.",television,"Hosting a watch party with 10 of my furthest strangers.

2280,9-1-1 is the most entertaining pile of garbage I’ve even seen,"I just need to rant for a moment about this beautiful piece of shit. 9-1-1 is currently on its third season at Fox. Being a Ryan Murphy production, I’m assuming a lot of reddit users never gave it a chance. Allow me to persuade you.

The show follows a crime or accident from three different perspectives: the firefighters, the police, and the 9-1-1 operators. We see each group follow multiple events each episode. Said events are “ripped from the headlines” meaning they have all technically happened. Since they need to keep topping the last episode, the accidents get crazier and crazier. 

Some of the accidents include: 

A plane crashing into the ocean

A shark eats a man on a freeway

A bath salts zombie

A man gets rebar stuck through his skull (and lives)

A fucking tsunami hits California with no warning 

A bouncy house blows off of a mountain with children inside 

A rollercoaster malfunctions leaving people hanging upside down

Now here’s why this is amazing: all of these are dealt with by the **same crew every time**. And they approach each incident with a “business as usual” attitude that is just brilliant. All of these near-impossible disasters take place within days of each other and the absurdity is barely acknowledged. 

This is all sandwiched between the most contrived and hilarious personal drama you’ve ever seen. In the first scene in which we are introduced to Angela Bassett’s family, the father comes out as gay to his children. This is played as a big emotional moment for the characters that we *just met thirty seconds ago.* This leads to the daughter getting bullied and attempting suicide in the next episode. The mother, Angela Bassett, then *arrests the bully under false pretenses.*. THIS ALL HAPPENS SO FAST AND ITS BARELY MENTIONED AFTER THE FACT.

Don’t even get me started on Jennifer Love Hewitt. She replaces Connie Britton as the main 9-1-1 operator in the second season, because apparently Connie can only work with Ryan Murphy ten episodes at a time. Hewitt plays Maddie, who bursts into tears during every single fucking one of her calls. Like, I feel like an operator should have some semblance of control over their emotions, but not Maddie. She lets them tears flow freely pretty much every episode. And she talks about quitting every five minutes, and I’m yelling at the screen like “Yes! Quit! You clearly can’t do this!”  But you just know she’s not gonna fucking quit.

But my last, and most important point, is the budget. Because while the show I’ve described is cheesy as hell, it’s one of the most technically impressive shows I’ve even seen. Like the effects are genuinely good and it’s obvious that a lot of effort has been put into making the show look great. Plus, you have Angela Bassett there to chew the fuck out of the scenery.

That’s all I have to say. If anyone actually reads this shit I really can’t recommend the show enough.

2333,I just finished Fleabag...wow,"Five minutes ago I finished this fantastic show and wow. I got to admit I had some trouble finishing season 1 and it took me a while, but I simply watched season 2 in one sitting. It's one of the most fantastic pieces of television I've seen, my heart is kind of broken but my god, what a perfect ending.

Fleabag resonated with me a lot and I felt identification with her, but I don't even know why, since we practically don't have a lot in common. I just think this show is about love, hope, finding a place, about meaning, and so many more things that are life. We all struggle with that, I've been having a rough life these past months, but this show made me feel, not sure what, but it really made me feel.

Part send up/homage of Masonic lodge mysteries, part vicious satire of rah rah corporate/MLM culture, it is funny and heart felt.","Lodge 49 is the story of two siblings dealing with the death of their father. Dud is a good natured laid back stoner dude who stumbles into a Lynx Lodge (an obvious spoof on Masonic Lodge) and decides to join. There he had all kinds of adventures exploring the deep mysteries about the founder of the lodge and a secret scroll of power that may or may not exist. 

Liz meanwhile cycles thru several employments where she hilariously deals with ruthless rah rah corporate culture and even joins an MLM at one point. The barbed take down of corporate America is really refreshing to see and unusual.

2343,The most compelling moments in television history.,"I would like to start a discussion on the most compelling, moving, impactful moments in all of television. I tried to find clips of these scenes, but some were unavailable, so I have just listed the episode number instead. I will keep it limited to one scene per show. Feel free to add your own to the list. 

**The Sopranos.** 

S06E14 “Stage 5” – Evidently Chickentown. 

There were so many scenes to choose from the Sopranos I found it difficult to keep myself to one. However, this scene which appeared at the very end of an episode, left me with a profound feeling of unease and dread. While this moment in terms of plot was relatively unimportant, the way it foreshadowed the chaos and bloodshed which would occur in future episodes was deeply unsettling. Somehow this song was able to demonstrate the total breakdown of Tony and Chris’s relationship even though no words were exchanged. A truly dark and ominous scene, I have no idea how this song worked so well. 

**The Wire.**

S03E11 “Middle Ground” – The Death of Stringer Bell.

The confrontation between Omar and Stringer marked the climax and pinnacle of The Wire in my opinion. The show did a brilliant job of depicting Stringers increased involvement and interest in the financial world. His economic classes, his adoption of corporate strategies in organised crime and his actions towards legitimizing himself. All of this culminating in the realisation for the viewer that he was in over his head, as smart as Stringer was, the wealthy people of Baltimore were always going figure out a way to separate a drug dealer from his money. Stringers death symbolizes the impossibility of escaping a life of crime and poverty. 

**Hannibal.** 

S02E12 “Mizumono” – Hannibal kills Abigail. 

This entire episode belongs on this list in my opinion; however, this scene was probably a 12/10 in an episode where not a moment was below 10/10. This scene provides the audience with a rare insight into the mind of a brilliant, complex and very disturbed individual. Hannibal had kept Abigail all this time as a surprise for Will, evidence that the teacup could regather itself and complete their family. However, Will’s betrayal was obviously deeply hurtful to Hannibal and Abigail had to die. Outstanding acting in this episode by Mads Mikkelsen as usual. 

**Mad Men** 

S06E13 “In Care Of” – Don's façade shatters during Hershey pitch. 

One of the main themes of Mad Men was the idea that Don Draper is a façade (or person suit in Hannibal) used by Dick Whitman to hide from his past. In this scene Don’s assured and confident persona breaks down. He begins to share intimate details regarding his childhood when in an environment where professionalism is required. It greatly illuminates the extent to which Don Draper, despite his successes, is a very unhappy and despairing individual. 

**Twin Peaks** 

S02E14 “Lonely Souls” – Melancholy at the Roadhouse. 

This is the episode where Laura Palmers killer is finally revealed to the audience. The brutal murder of Madeline Palmer is only the second most unsettling part of this episode. Simultaneous to her murder, the inhabitants of Twin peaks are all at The Roadhouse. Every character there knows something truly terrible is happening, yet nobody knows what. As Agent Cooper is told by the giant in a vision it is happening again, Donna begins to sob and Bobby is overcome by sadness. A poignant and disturbing moment in a show also famous for its quirkiness and humour. 

**Honourable mentions:** 

**Breaking Bad** S05E14 “Ozymandias” – Hanks death. 

**GOT** S01E10 “Fire and Blood” – Daenerys hatches her dragons. 

**Big Little Lies** S01E06 “You Get What You Need” – Perry’s true nature is revealed. 

**Mindhunter** S01E10 “Lone Wolf” – Holden’s Panic Attack. 

**Succession** S01E06 “Which Side Are You On” – The vote of no confidence. 

**The Americans** S05E13 “The Soviet Division” – Paige doesn’t get on the train. 

**Bates Motel** S04E10 “Norman” – Norma is dead. 

**Freaks and Geeks** E18 “Discos and Dragons”- Lindsey gets on the bus.

**Sharp Objects** E06 “Cherry” Camille and Amma take ecstasty. 

**Halt and Catch Fire** S04E07 “Who Needs a Guy” – Gordons death.

2344,Fleabag and Killing Eve is more about brilliant performance by the protagonist than story,"So both the shows are quite popular now and have won lot of praise for performance and story.

I think PWB and Jodie Comer are the reason why the show works well with audience but otherwise are quite average show.

Fleabag attempts to generate sympathy for the lead stating that she was hit by a recent tragedy, but in show that is hardly important. Irrespective of that She is a horrible person.Show posters and its promotion tells how her mother death has affected her and how she deals with it.But her character in show doesn't need that background as I don't see that having any effect on the character.

Most unrealistic part of Killing Eve apart from the fact that everything is super easy for Villanelle, is that she is supposed to fall in love with Eve, a dull and boring person.

And to believe that Sandra Oh won Golden globes for that.

Jodie Comer is charming in the role and writing of the show is just average, more boring drama than a thriller.

2379,"What regular complaints about TV shows and/or the TV industry do you find unreasonable, unjustified or just plain stupid??","**Complaint #1: ""LGBT+ groups being over-represented in TV shows.""**

I thought I'd start off with one of the most frequent complaints, and also one of the most ridiculous. Like, it's mind-blogging to me why anyone could even think this, or even care. Are they so uncomfortable with seeing gays, trans etc. in TV shows? And I must clarify, even though I do see posts and comments like that on this subreddit sometimes, it's not just here, it's twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms. I see comments like ""Why are there so many gays on TV lately?"" ""Damn, even -*insert title here*\-'s gay now"" way too often. No, it's not true, LGBT+ groups aren't being over-represented on TV. Yes, they are present more than they were *let's say* 5 years ago. Sure some shows are more LGBT+ friendly than others, but what do you mean by ""over-represented"" exactly? Do you think show-creators should go ""Oh, only 10% of the worlds population is gay, so only 10% of characters in my show should be gay""?? People are gay, get over it.

**Complaint #2: ""Too many sex scenes in TV shows""**

I've been seeing complaints like this for a while now, but I don't understand why it bothers people so much. In most cases it's just another scene, what's the difference? Do they ever complain about car chase scenes, shoot-out scenes, training montages etc. Though, I do admit, most sex scenes are wack, especially non TV-MA ones where they don't have uncensored freedom, but I can't say it has ever bother me to the point where I have to come online to complain about it. But I think there's a factor these complainers are missing. In the more explicit cases, sex is usually there for world-building, style or erotica whether artsy or plain.

**Complaint #3: ""Netflix originals aren't good. They're mostly teen-oriented""**

""Teen shows = bad"", I feels like I've been seeing this for years, never understood the hate for the genre. Sure there are some bad teen shows out there but there are also some great ones, just as there are great crime-dramas and bad ones, or any other genre as a matter a fact. Now a don't know the reason behind Netflix targeting young adults, but if you're telling me there isn't at least 3 Netflix originals that you like, you're not watching Netflix originals. And I'd be curious to know what these people like exactly. Netflix has had a quite stellar lineup of original so far, the only network I can think of that's better is HBO.

**Complaint #4: ""Friends and The Office leaving Netflix""**

Now Friends and The Office are 2 of the most watched shows on Netflix, and there's an uproar every time there's a threat/rumor of them leaving. Honestly, what can I say, there was no promise that Netflix would keep these or any other licensed show forever. If they're you favorites, you should probably buy the Blu-ray or get it digitally and save it to a hard-drive or something.

**Complaint #5: ""Netflix cancelling TV shows""**

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about when people get upset about their favorite shows being cancelled, I'm talking about people who seem to have convinced themselves Netflix shouldn't cancel TV shows at all. It's a TV network people, just like HBO, Amazon Prime, FX etc. If a shows viewership isn't up to standard, why should they keep spending money to make it??

**Complaint #6: ""Characters making dumb decisions""**

Now this one is probably the most justifiable on the list because TV characters really do be making dumb decisions, and sometimes it is due to bad bad writing, but too many times I've seen people complaining about characters making dumb decisions when it is the fueling factor for drama and excitement in the show. Think of it this way, art imitates life, and people make dumb decisions as much or even more than TV characters. If you were in a similar situation as that character what decision would you have made? If all TV characters go around making good decisions all the time, well that would be no fun would it. You think you want that, but you don't.   

**Complaint #7: ""Trash like \_\_\_\_\_\_ are still on while my favorite shows are criminally underrated""**

In my opinion calling something that millions of people are consistently watching 'trash' is never justifiable. And this applies to ""Why was this cancelled?"" and ""Why are they still making this?"" complaints as well. Not seeming to understand that one's own taste and that of one's small circle of acquaintances just might not extrapolate to the world in general seems to be the main issue here. Not everything is made for you, not everything will appeal to you.",television,"What regular complaints about TV shows and/or the TV industry do you find unreasonable, unjustified or just plain stupid?? **Complaint #1: ""LGBT+ groups being over-represented in TV shows.""**

I thought I'd start off with one of the most frequent complaints, and also one of the most ridiculous. Like, it's mind-blogging to me why anyone could even think this, or even care. Are they so uncomfortable with seeing gays, trans etc. in TV shows? And I must clarify, even though I do see posts and comments like that on this subreddit sometimes, it's not just here, it's twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms. I see comments like ""Why are there so many gays on TV lately?"" ""Damn, even -*insert title here*\-'s gay now"" way too often. No, it's not true, LGBT+ groups aren't being over-represented on TV. Yes, they are present more than they were *let's say* 5 years ago. Sure some shows are more LGBT+ friendly than others, but what do you mean by ""over-represented"" exactly? Do you think show-creators should go ""Oh, only 10% of the worlds population is gay, so only 10% of characters in my show should be gay""?? People are gay, get over it.

**Complaint #2: ""Too many sex scenes in TV shows""**

I've been seeing complaints like this for a while now, but I don't understand why it bothers people so much. In most cases it's just another scene, what's the difference? Do they ever complain about car chase scenes, shoot-out scenes, training montages etc. Though, I do admit, most sex scenes are wack, especially non TV-MA ones where they don't have uncensored freedom, but I can't say it has ever bother me to the point where I have to come online to complain about it. But I think there's a factor these complainers are missing. In the more explicit cases, sex is usually there for world-building, style or erotica whether artsy or plain.

**Complaint #3: ""Netflix originals aren't good. They're mostly teen-oriented""**

""Teen shows = bad"", I feels like I've been seeing this for years, never understood the hate for the genre.

2381,Rewatching The Big Bang Theory and NOT impressed.,"begins rant/

So my MO when I'm feeling low is to watch things that remind me of the days when I was happy. And TBBT definitely succeeded in that I'm not feeling low anymore. I'm mad.

The problem starts with Penny, 22(when the show begins), barely educated by most of all condescending. I'm my mind she represents a typical Midwestern American - superiority complex, lives in a bubble, disrespects other cultures, entitled because she's good looking and almost as bad as Sheldon's mother. Just because the guys are different from her ""idea"" of what's normal and socially ""accepted"" she feels she's better than them somehow. It blame the American education system of course. The rampant bullying, prizing brawn over brain, violent solutions to mundane problems and a general entitlement of people who have insecurities. Penny is all of these. She doesn't really feel bad about bullying people, she's just embarrassed because Bernie and Amy judge her. She was doing it because ""they"" were looking down at ""her"" and she always needs the be in the right. 

The blatant lack of acknowledgement of Sheldon's condition, is another thing. Sheldon clearly had OCD and lies on the autism spectrum. Instead of understanding his problems the circle just exploits his quirks. Even when he does nothing but help people to the best of his abilities like lending Penny money, helping the guys get onto projects, helping Raj, supporting Howard when he fucks up, he's always there for his friends but they just use him as fodder for their needs. Especially of course, Penny. Yes he's obnoxious but he isn't mean spirited which miss no-last-name absolutely is. 

This is more of an anti penny rant because honestly she treats her friends like shit. And k can't believe American Media airs stuff like this. It's so extremely full of racism, classism and endorses stereotypes which is fun in a satirical wag to an intellectual audience but considering where it's aired the audience is not that. Maybe about 25% will not take everything shown literally. It's sad. I used to live this show up until a couple of years back and now it's just blah.

2390,Eureka is an amazing show,"I watched Eureka when it first aired, and remember it being fun but otherwise a standard cheesy and forgettable Syfy show. I recently found it again when scrolling through Prime Video and decided to rewatch, and was completely blown away this time around.

The premise is simple — “sheriff of a town full of geniuses prevents runaway experiments from destroying the town or worse”. The science stuff is definitely cheesy and lighthearted, and that works to the show’s advantage. The monster of the week theme does get a bit repetitive and tiresome at times, but the overall arcs and fun characters still keep you going. I would describe the show as a non-serious Fringe which still manages to deal with heavy topics like science &amp; technology, morality, AI, time travel, alternate timelines and more.

The defining feature of the show to me is its amazing set of characters. I can’t think of any other show that has this big of a primary, secondary and tertiary cast and yet makes you genuinely care about each one of them. Every character has a rich backstory and develops beautifully and sensibly through the series’ run. The all have amazing chemistry and seem to be having a blast on set.

Something else I noticed during the rewatch is how clever and layered the writing is. Characters regularly reference tiny plot points that happened seasons ago. Interactions with experiments and very minor characters sometimes have consequences way down the line. The show completely switches timelines three times during its run and somehow pulls off each one of them. It manages to effortlessly switch from being hilariously funny to very serious to tearjerker, sometimes within the span of a single episode.

2391,Better Than Us is worst for Russia (spoilers),"Help me like this series. 

Are Russian film artists so hyper-aware of the lack of innovation in Russia that the entire premise has to be based on Chinese innovation?

The driven investigator doesn't act driven. 

The translations are awkward at times. The subtitles make more sense, and the voice acting is not that great.

The Chinese bot that is the subject presents several problems. Full capabilities are never used.

They never change the face of the bot from the original design. 

The extreme advertisements with the original face never prompted Chinese action, which doesn't make sense, because they knew it was a black market murder bot.

None of the characters are really written as though they are intelligent, and few of their motivations have enough exposition or foundation. 

It's like reading a slow novel where the characters are boring, lack real motivation, and nobody thinks to share vital information when there is clear motivation to do so.

I need more information about the Russian criminal justice system. Since when are people not detained when clear evidence exists without, at the very least, significant bribery. 

Last minute insertion of cannon fodder characters to add mayhem/drama without any real need.

Since when do you arrange to escape trial, jail, and possible death, to a tropical non-extradition country ... a week form now, and not now.

I have no idea who these actors are in the intro, because they are all in Russian only.

Why didn't they let full AI become more apparent progressively, and do some exciting things with that, especially since there was so much dead space to fill.

So many continuity and technical errors.

2395,[Spoilers] How I met your Mother is kind of over-hated?,"Okay its an old series but I rewatched it because I really did not understand all the hate past S4-S5. I first binge watched HIMYM back in 2015 on my friend's recommendation. Im not saying people are not allowed to dislike this series but really was it that bad that it was unwatchable? 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Most of my friends who didnt like HIMYM complained about how ridiculous fantasy like the stories were past S4. Well the thing with that is whenever there is a movie/series about a character telling a story of their past I just inherently assume they are going to tell it like it is a hyperbole. Hell Barney's stories in Ted's recollection were the biggest exaggerations and I for one really enjoyed those stories. Like his story about the sexless inn-keeper and the hundred others. One ridiculous story was Robin being thrown into the wild to live 3 days in survival mode. But even then it was just for explaining the issues she had with her father. I feel this going-back-to-the-past to tell a story is a very smart tool for writers because it gives them this extra freedom to be a little ""ridiculous"". Even personally when me and my friends are feeling a little nostalgic we have that moment where we tell a funny story and laugh hysterically while people keep adding things to make it even funnier are the best stories and it goes without saying it gets a little ridiculous. 
2. One thing I do agree on is the way they decided to space out the whole thing. I do not remember the exact seasons but I did feel that a couple seasons were a little dragged. But I really did enjoy most seasons. I'd even say the ending might have been a little abrupt. They could have explained a little more on why Barney and Robin started arguing. The whole Robin got too busy thing was forced but still believable. The first time they broke up they had like an entire episode on what had happened to them and stuff. The biggest wtf was when they killed off Tracy in a matter of seconds. On the same point, my friends also said that they did a very sloppy job on showing how Tracy was perfect for Ted. Which I kinda agree on, they just mentioned like a couple things like that chain mail armor thing and her being in a band and stuff.  And what I am going to say next to justify why that might have been okay might seem  little outlandish but hear me out - it was never Tracy's story. I will get back to this. 
3. Barney/Marshal/Lily involvement with their arcs. This was never really an issue but this is one reason why we felt it was a little dragged out. I did not mind these arcs personally. But we did agree that some things could have been done differently like Marshal should not have gotten so much story time with his career. It was like way too dragged out imo. Lily's dad also felt unnecessary how much screen time that whole thing with father issues got. Again, I did not mind those arcs while watching them but in the grand scheme of things it really does beg the question if it was necessary at all. Well Idk about Marshal/Lily but for all arcs related to Barney and Robin they really did matter because it all added to how they got married. This is a story of Ted and Robin. 

(There were other reasons too which i dont wanna mention because this post is too long as is. But in a gist just Ted  being ridiculous and frustrating as a character and what not.) In the end it all comes down Ted and Robin. Even the kids at the end say this was never about Tracy. This story was about if they were okay with him getting together with Robin. Coming back to my reason number 2. This was never Tracy's story. Ted was telling this story because he wanted to be with Robin. In the story he always said its always been Robin and Marshal always said ""not yet"" to Lily about his bet. When I first watched S1 I knew this story was going to be about Robin. She was a main character and the way she was introduced was almost a dead giveaway. But then the whole thing panned out and the stories were told; Barney marries Robin and for a second I thought okay maybe this is not really about Robin. But then right when it is ending it goes back to the blue french horn and then it hit me. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ROBIN. I asked myself would I have enjoyed the story if it was not Robin at the end and honestly I would have been disappointed if it was not.  This whole story was meant to be told in a matter of 30 minutes. That's why the kids are always in the same clothes. Same place. Same age. Ted is the kind of character to go his whole life just to find ""the one"" to fulfill his destiny and all that jazz. He was always like that with his idea of a perfect first date and how he went back to Robin's place. The writers probably had this vision right from the beginning. I am glad they stuck to the original version.",television,"[Spoilers] How I met your Mother is kind of over-hated?

But we did agree that some things could have been done differently like Marshal should not have gotten so much story time with his career. It was like way too dragged out imo. Lily's dad also felt unnecessary how much screen time that whole thing with father issues got. Again, I did not mind those arcs while watching them but in the grand scheme of things it really does beg the question if it was necessary at all. Well Idk about Marshal/Lily but for all arcs related to Barney and Robin they really did matter because it all added to how they got married. This is a story of Ted and Robin. 

(There were other reasons too which i dont wanna mention because this post is too long as is. But in a gist just Ted  being ridiculous and frustrating as a character and what not.) In the end it all comes down Ted and Robin. Even the kids at the end say this was never about Tracy. This story was about if they were okay with him getting together with Robin. Coming back to my reason number 2. This was never Tracy's story. Ted was telling this story because he wanted to be with Robin. In the story he always said its always been Robin and Marshal always said ""not yet"" to Lily about his bet. When I first watched S1 I knew this story was going to be about Robin. She was a main character and the way she was introduced was almost a dead giveaway. But then the whole thing panned out and the stories were told; Barney marries Robin and for a second I thought okay maybe this is not really about Robin. But then right when it is ending it goes back to the blue french horn and then it hit me. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ROBIN. I asked myself would I have enjoyed the story if it was not Robin at the end and honestly I would have been disappointed if it was not.  This whole story was meant to be told in a matter of 30 minutes. That's why the kids are always in the same clothes. Same place. Same age. Ted is the kind of character to go his whole life just to find ""the one"" to fulfill his destiny and all that jazz. He was always like that with his idea of a perfect first date and how he went back to Robin's place. The writers probably had this vision right from the beginning. I am glad they stuck to the original version.",0

2405,Just finished the first season of The Haunting of Hill House. Wow. I don't think I've ever seen a show that...,"...completely fucked itself over in the last 45 minutes like that.

The finale was a jarring shift in tone and mood, and ultimately this feel-good ending felt forced, needlessly melodramatic, and poorly written.

We have 9+ hours of this house being an embodiment of evil. The house makes mothers kill their children thinking they're protecting them, it manipulates you into suicide, it destroys families, it ruins lives...

But wait, it's actually full of love and happiness and a place for the dead to reunite and spend eternity together. ""Those who walk there, walk together."" What????

The ending monologue was so ridiculous that I felt we were going to get to a reveal that the last half hour or so was a dream. Like, this well-written show can't really be losing its edge this close to the end, right? What happened to the subtlety that this show was a master at?

The happily-ever-after ending felt hollow. It felt emotionally-manipulative. It didn't feel earned, and it certainly didn't feel like anything remotely close to horror.

2422,best shows i have watched (OPINION),"Watched not too many shows in total (61). I need to watch more but here are my 15 favorites of those 61 and my thoughts and rating out of ten for each show:

1. **Breaking Bad**: Best show ever debatably. Never ever have or will be so invested or addicted to a show. The characters, story, and originality surpass all other shows. **(9.8/10)**
2. **Bojack Horseman**: Best cartoon show ever created. I am prepared to debate that claim. The first season was misleading for the style of the whole show. I am so excited for season 6 on October 25th. **(9.3/10)**
3. **Rick and Morty**: God this show is a blessing. So funny. Pulls in comedy, science fiction, and other fans. November 10th we get 5 more episodes for season 4! **(9.5/10)**
4. **New Girl**: Nich Miller. Nich f\*cking Miller. A great show with an ""okay"" last season. This is a show that is a perfect length and I can recommend it to many people. **(9.0/10)**
5. **Schitt's Creek**: What an underrated show. A great variety of characters, an intriguing plot, and an interesting setting all add to the magnitude of this show. I love it and more people should too. **(9.0/10)**
6. **Grey's Anatomy**: A long and grueling show but, in my opinion, worth it. This is the first ""big"" show I have conquered and I loved it until season 13. Very good consistency. **(8.5/10)**
7. **Parks and Recreation**: This show is perfect, except for the first season. It is consistently funny and has the right amount of drama to keep many viewers hooked. I'll say it, it's better than The Office. **(9.0/10)**
8. **Better Call Saul**: The absolute perfect follow-up show for Breaking Bad. It's perfect that it also does not just include the backstory of James McGill. It can also be watched without Breaking Bad. **(9.2/10)**
9. **Stranger Things**: So much hype for this show and for good reasons. It takes its own style and reaches out to folks of age and kids who like to see the ""retro"" lifestyle with science fiction. **(9.0/10)**
10. **Adventure Time**: Best childhood show out there. It has the right amount of just fun episodes and a storyline a nerdy adult and a kid can follow and appreciate. Love it, not perfect though. Some episodes are lazy. **(8.0/10)**
11. **Arrow**: The best ""superhero"" show out there. That's bold, but I've watched all Marvel and DC shows but have not enjoyed it as much as Arrow. It does the whole ""flashback"" part very well. **(8.0/10)**
12. **Full House**: Another good childhood favorite of mine. I watched it on DVDs as a kid and I remember just getting so invested in this classic family situational comedy. **(8.4/10)**
13. **The Good Place**: One of the best original plots of the modern-day. The interpretation shown in this show is so funny and can get anyone who is not orthodox religious invested. **(8.8/10)**
14. **Blindspot**: Another underrated show. An original plot for a crime show is something that is overlooked in this show. The character's reactions are so perfect to remind people of true crime. **(7.8/10)**
15. **Orange is the New Black**: Another pretty long show with another original plot. A women's prison, interesting crimes, and classic abuse make this show real enough and still original. **(8.7/10)**",television,"best shows i have watched (OPINION) Watched not too many shows in total (61).

2429,Bojack Horseman S4E11 “Time’s Arrow” is a masterpiece of visual storytelling and character writing,"So I just started watching Bojack Horseman. Up until this point, I’ve been becoming increasingly engrossed in the show, and increasingly aware of its artistic merit as both a dark comedy and an insightful drama, Then I arrived at this episode. And HOLY FUCKING SHIT this show is a masterpiece. 

Everything, from the subtle details of the mother’s distorted memories and perception of reality, with the blank faces, flickering lettering and blurry backgrounds to the abrupt shift in our view of her as a character, are just so masterfully crafted. Up until this point, I’d been inclined to share Bojack’s view of his mother, as a neglectful, shitty parent. Even after the episode where Bojack is at the lake house, I still didn’t view the mother as sympathetic at all. 

Then this episode shows up, and all that is turned on it’s head. This character, who is objectively one of the most reprehensible in the show, is suddenly understandable and human. There have already been some similarly complex character arcs, but I don’t think any of them have been this well written and executed. Basically what I’m I’m trying to say is, this show is a masterclass in crafting complex characters, and not only a standout in the animated genre but as a work of art.
